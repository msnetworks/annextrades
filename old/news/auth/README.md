# Javascript SDK oAuth 2.0 based FBConnect

Today Facebook released their updated JavaScript SDK. Now the authentication system is based on OAuth 2.0 and HTTPS. So I updated my previous tutorial by writing this new post. In this post I'll show you using javascript how could you easily integrate facebook connect (login/logout) features in your site. Additionally how to use Facebook API to get user's information. Here I only used JavaScript no back-end PHP or any server side language.
