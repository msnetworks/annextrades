Historically, what has been the State Department?s biggest challenge in covering assignments? ? The volume of interpreters needed for a single time slot. Having 9 requests for a 10 ? 12 timeslots on any given day. ? The skillsets of interpreters ? Interpreters must not only possess executive level interpreting skills but also need to be able to tailor that skill to meet the multi-faceted needs of the Department?s employees. 2. We understand that there could be 14,000 hours/year CONUS/OCONUS with 2,000 hours needing cleared interpreters with TS/SCI. Can the State Department clarify if this is 14,000 standard hours, with 2,000 additional cleared hours? ? The current posture as it relates to COVID has led to a large decline in the number of cleared interpreters required. In 2020 we used 231.00 SCI hours, 150.00 Top Secret hours and 2,163.50 Secret hours. All labor hour are driven by requests for cleared services. 3. Can the State Department provide a historical data breakdown from the past year on: The total number of hours of services (for ASL Interpreting and CART services) a. The number of all-day on-call assignments (interpreters/writers scheduled 7 or more hours per day on the same days each week) ? We currently request services for 6 daily on-call interpreters (8 hours) and 1 oncall for 6 hours. b. The number of assignments that were 3 hours or less c. The number of assignments that were 7 hours or more d. The number of hours of evening/weekend work ? 2021 we had 0 Weekend hours. ? 2019 we had 2 Saturday (24.00) requests and 4 Sunday (23.50) requests e. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 5 business days? notice) f. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 1 business days? notice) ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2021 we had 294 requests totaling 742.50 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2020 we had 287 requests totaling 611.25 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2019 we had 360 requests totaling 513.75 hours g. How many requests were outside of the main location? ? 2019 we supported one employee daily for 8 hours OCONUS with a TS/SCI clearance ? 2019, 2021 and 2022 we also provide 8 hours daily interpreting on the West Coast at one of our locations. ? We provide interpreting services in New Orleans, New York and San Francisco with less than 8 hours per month. 4. In the RFI document, it states ?Interpret and/or transliterate continuously for not more than two (2) hours at a time without a break. In order to prevent repetitive motion injuries industry standard requires 2 interpreters for assignments requiring over 1.5 hours of continuous interpreting. Will the State Department confirm that a team will be provided when there will be 1.5 hours or more of continuous interpreting? ? Our ASL team is comprised of Certified Sign Language Interpreters who actively provide interpreting services for the Department. Each request is approached as not only fulfilling the assignment but also ensuring that the integrity of the message can be maintained while examining factors such as length of time, technicality, number of customers involved etc. The Department follows the 2-hour minimum as a rule with consideration given to other factors. 5. The RFI states there is a requirement for CART but does not specify whether the requirement is for onsite or remote CART. Will the State Department clarify whether it requires onsite or remote CART or both? ? The Government requires both. CART usage Is low (2019 - 19 requests totaling 114 hours). 6. There is a drastic difference between on-site CART writer and remote CART writer with on-site CART needing a 30-minute set-up time prior to the start of an assignment and each having very different minimum charges. Will the State Department recognize the difference when issuing their solicitation in the future? We suggest adding a CLIN to allow separate pricing for these services so that vendors can provide the most competitive pricing possible. ? Yes, we will consider this. ? All service providers are required to arrive 30 minutes prior to the assignment to provide enough time to get to the location and to be ready to begin at the designated time. In the case of interpreters, this time is not billed.

In FY21, ED&CMO issued three Technology Verticals using the Pilot IRS framework (on average, those procurement actions took less than 30 calendar days from solicitation to contract award). ?The three FY21 Technology Verticals focused on: 1) extracting machine readable data from low resolution and poor quality images and hard copy documents (summarized as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)); 2) digitalizing paper documents and transmitting the digital files back to the IRS via a digital channel (summarized as Scanning as a Service (SCaaS); and, 3) generate information which improves the taxpayer experience when a mobile device is directed at IRS images, forms, etc., based on publicly available information (summarized as Augmented Reality (AR)). ?As intended, all three Technology Verticals resulted in multiple awards with an initial period of 30 days to 6 months, followed by a targeted selection of a smaller number of industry partners for contract option exercise and continued funding. ?Each of the Technology Verticals has contributed significantly to the understanding and awareness of ED&CMO, and although industry partners in all three areas continue to be funded, additional investment in these areas will continue to be dependent on Return on Investment, the ability of the solutions to serve the needs of the IRS, and overarching prioritization decisions. In FY22, ED&CMO intends on issuing two to three additional Technology Verticals, again relying on the Pilot IRS framework. ?Currently, those Technology Verticals will focus on three topic areas: 1) the application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Robotic Process Automation (AI/ML/RPA) in human resources processes (i.e., using automation to accelerate manual processes); 2) process and technology solutions to improve high-manual touch processes that have limited visibility before they are completed; and, 3) cryptocurrency and digital assets. ?ED&CMO anticipates finalizing the topic areas by April 30th. ED&CMO may have other procurement needs in FY22, but it does have existing vehicles (which were completed in FY20) that it will leverage for the majority, if not all, of these needs. ?As the topic areas for the Technology Verticals are finalized, ED&CMO will issue additional special notices, Requests for Information, and will provide ample opportunity to engage with our industry partners.?? ?

The successful proposer must demonstrate how they meet or exceed the minimum requirements and deliverable expectations listed in this RFP as well as the general contractual requirements of the County. The intent of this solicitation is to establish one or more agreements with a firm/individual who best meets the criteria set forth herein and provides the best overall value to the County.

This RFP includes a description of the evaluation and selection process, scope of work, and proposal requirements that must be met to be eligible for consideration.

The City of Plano is soliciting proposals for an award program to recognize employee longevity. Program should be designed so rewards are not taxable to the employee.

Questions must be submitted electronically through IonWave at planotx.ionwave.net.  No questions will be answered over the phone or through email.

The preferred method for proposal submission is electronically through IonWave. If you choose to submit your bid/proposal in person, Purchasing personnel will be available Mondays and Wednesdays between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. The person delivering the bid/proposal must call (972) 941-7557 upon arrival during those hours and wait in the lobby for someone to meet them to receive their bid/proposal. Responses delivered in person are to be delivered in a sealed envelope to the Purchasing Department at:

City of Plano Purchasing Department
1520 K Avenue
Plano, TX 75074
Ph: (972) 941-7557

All responses are due prior to the published closing date and time. No late responses will be accepted.

Bids/Proposals will be opened, and the names of offerors read, on Tuesday, June 7, 2022, at 2:00 PM CT. The reading will take place at City Hall, in the Council Chambers; which has space for social distancing available.  Tabulations for these solicitations should be available on Ionwave within 48 hours of the opening. In some cases, they may be available earlier. We ask that you limit exposure by viewing tabulations electronically through IonWave, rather than attending at City Hall.
Time Critical Bid/Proposal Deliveries: The City of Plano cannot guarantee, due to internal procedures, that any bids/proposals sent via US mail will be picked up and delivered by the closing date and time. It is recommended that critical bid/proposal deliveries be made either electronically through IonWave or in person as described above. It is further recommended that users review all electronic response attachments to ensure the uploaded files are able to be downloaded and viewed. Instructions for this, if needed, can be found in the Supplier Bid Response Quick Tutorial online in Ionwave or by calling Ionwave Support at 866-277-2645. Responses or parts of a response whether hardcopy or electronic that cannot be viewed may deem your submittal as non-responsive. In addition, the City reserves the right to request clarification in such cases.

 Consulting: Insurance and Benefit Plan Bids,DC,Industry Day for OWCP Medical Physician Network and Medical Bill Processing Services,Federal,,Department of Labor,"Jun 7, 2022",Department of Labor,https://sam.gov/opp/a17363a7ab3a4b4a87619189d3355fc6/view,"1638-DAO-22-NAT-0044    		    		 ",Purchasing,,866-487-2365,Evans.Tomeka.S@dol.gov,,"OVERVIEW: The Department of Labor (DOL) is continuing to conduct market research on industry?s capabilities to provide nationwide medical provider services by means of a provider network or networks, and to serve as a third-party biller to receive and process medical bills according to industry standards and OWCP rules (where necessary).? A virtual Industry Day is planned for June 23, 2022, to discuss the Government?s current, revised objectives for services and industry?s capabilities and standard processes. This notice is in follow-up to the Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) #1638-DFC-21-NAT-0001 previously posted in July 2021.? The objectives are substantively changed from the prior RFI to remove Directed Medical Services and alter the requirements related to the provider network. The current, revised Statement of Objectives (SOO) is attached to this notice. INDUSTRY DAY DETAILS: The June 23rd Industry Day will be held virtually via a platform such a Microsoft Teams, WebEx or Zoom.? It is expected to last between three (3) and four (4) hours.? The time of and a link to the event will follow the RSVP period.? Unless otherwise instructed at the time of response, the Government intends to promote networking among interested vendors and other Industry Day attendees by sharing the names and contact information of all registered attendees. The Government is seeking feedback on OWCP?s latest objectives, and to better understand current industry capabilities and common practices in medical networks and medical bill processing. The Government is also seeking to explore alternative Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structures based on specific objectives within the SOO. At a high level, the Industry Day agenda will include opening statements by the DOL Office of Acquisition Services and Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization, an overview of OWCP objectives for MPN-MBP services, discussion of commonalities and differences between the OWCP programs? service needs, and a question-and-answer period for additional conversation. DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, ACCESSIBILITY (DEIA): Obtaining a diverse pool of medical services providers is an important part of the requirements in contracts for medical services for OWCP.? The provision below is included in the MPN-MBP SOO.? It requires the contractor to utilize as diverse a group of medical service providers as practicable.? The satisfactory performance of services, and improvements in treatment outcomes, depends in part on overcoming barriers to access to medical services by underserved communities. SOO Provision:? Advancing Equity in the Pool of Medical Service Providers Supporting OWCP? In accordance with the statutes and regulations governing OWCP, including 5 U.S.C. Section 8103, implementing regulations at 20 C.F.R. Sections 10.300?et seq., as well as Executive Order (E.O.) 13985, which orders federal agency heads to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, the contractor shall to the greatest extent practicable provide a diverse pool of medical service providers and shall adopt policies and practices for the engagement of medical service providers (whether through hiring as employees, by subcontracting, or otherwise) that promote fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals.? The contractor shall advance equity in the process of hiring and/or subcontracting for medical service providers and shall take steps to overcome barriers that underserved communities and individuals may face in accessing medical services under OWCP programs.? In order to accomplish this, the contractor should conduct outreach to underserved communities with respect to employment and subcontracting opportunities, to include, among other things, working with affinity groups, colleges and universities, minority serving educational institutions, and other similar organizations, e.g., National Black Chamber of Commerce, Asian Pacific Partners for Empowerment, Advocacy & Leadership, the U.S. Hispanic Chambers of Commerce,? Hispanic Associations of Colleges and Universities (HACUs), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs). The contractor understands and agrees to the following:? That advancing equity in the pool of medical service providers, and in the provision of medical services, will have a positive impact on the delivery of the services required under this contract; that many disparities exist in the diagnosis and treatment of pain (and other symptoms, conditions) between persons of various backgrounds, due to factors such as language barriers, and socio-economic status; these disparities manifest not only in whether and how pain is perceived and communicated by individuals, but also in the clinical assessment and treatment of pain when reported by members of different communities; that the contractor?s efforts to advance diversity in the pool of medical service providers are important and necessary to overcome barriers to access by underserved communities in the diagnosis and treatment of pain, and to improve treatment outcomes for all under this contract.? Contractors must submit a monthly Medical Service Provider Diversity report.? The report must include a description of the contractor?s efforts to advance equity in the engagement of medical service providers that perform work under this contract, including efforts by subcontractors.? The report must also state the number of individuals from underserved communities that are providing medical services in support of this contract, and their geographic location within the country. This requirement shall apply to subcontractors at all tiers who perform medical services under this contract and a similar requirement must be included in every subcontract at any tier. The terms ?underserved communities,? ?diversity,? ?equity,? ?inclusion? and ?accessibility,? as used in this provision have the same definition as in E.O. 13985. HOW TO RESPOND: Please provide an RSVP by June 7, 2022, at 12p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) to the Industry Day POC?s.? Include the attendee name(s) and contact information that may be shared with other attendees for networking purposes.? Also include any questions to the Government about the current, revised SOO.

Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender?s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions, including alternative line items (provided that the alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation), or alternative commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. ?(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. The source selection method is Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.? FACTOR 1: Technical Capability; defined as the ability of the products to meet the salient characteristics needed. Evaluations will be based on vendors meeting the task descriptions in the attached SOW. FACTOR 2: Past Performance, provide two (2) references with the point of contact name, telephone number, address, and contract number, for which you have provided the same or similar services within the last 3 years. Past performance will be evaluated based on references and information from authorized government past performance systems and resources. FACTOR 3: Price; the government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable quotes with acceptable or neutral past performance. This requirement will be awarded as a Lowest Price Technically Accepted (LPTA) award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c)A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.

(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Evaluations will be based on vendors meeting the task descriptions in the attached SOW. FACTOR 2: Past Performance, provide two (2) references with the point of contact name, telephone number, address, and contract number, for which you have provided the same or similar services within the last 3 years. Past performance will be evaluated based on references and information from authorized government past performance systems and resources.

This requirement will be awarded as a Lowest Price Technically Accepted (LPTA) award. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c)A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Specifically, the Government will procure this from Life Technologies Corporation. Life Technologies is the sole manufacturer and reseller of the 3500xL Genetic Analyzers, the associated 3500 computers and 3500 data collection software for this requirement.? AFMES-DNAOps is a forensic DNA testing laboratory that is accredited by the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB) to the ISO-17025 and FBI-QAS for DNA Forensic Laboratories. Based on accreditation adherence (Volume III of the Quality Manual and the FBI's Quality Assurance Surveillance document), all equipment and software must be developmentally validated by the manufacturer and internally validated by the laboratory to all reagents used for DNA testing as well as pass a stringent quality control before being released for casework. Furthermore, forensic accreditation standards say that manufactures who supply DNA forensic instruments, reagents must have established Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)/ Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) process as well as being International Standard Organization -18385 Forensic DNA grade accredited. Life Technologies is ISO 18385 compliant for the forensic mtDNA and STR reagents, the 3500xL capillary electrophoresis instruments (3500xL Analyzer, computers and 3500 data collection software), and the GeneMapper ID-X software v1.6 that are used to analyze forensic DNA samples. AFMES-DNAOps is the DoD?s only human remains DNA testing laboratory, which under title 10 USC, chapter 75, 1471 and 10 USC, Chapter 76, 1501-1513; NDAA 2010, Section 541 (d)(2) and DODI 5154.30 is charged with providing human remains DNA testing in support of current day operations (AFMES), past accounting operations (Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency; DPAA), other DoD Agencies missions, and other Bureaus of the Federal Government, and civilian medical institutions. Life Technologies is the sole manufacture of the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer and the 3500 Data collection software that AFMES-DNAOps purchased in 2010 to replace the obsolete and discontinued ABI 3130xL Genetic Analyzer. The Life Technologies 3500xL Genetic Analyzer, associated WIN7 computers and data collection software versions 1.0 to 1.3 have been validated in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Investigations ? Quality Assurance Standards (FBI-QAS) and the ISO-17025 Accreditation standards by AFMES-DNAOps to work in conjunction with the Promega Fusion and Life Technologies Globalfiler and MiniFiler autosomal Short Tandem Repeat (STR) kits, and the Life Technologies Y-Chromosomal STR kit. Development, optimization and validation of automated and manual STR amplification methods in conjunction with analysis on the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer are used to identify missing individuals. Failure to utilize the forensically validated 3500xL computers and data collection software will lead to a 50% reduction in work product. This reduction in work product will prevent AFMES- DNAOps from supporting the Defense POWMIA Accounting Agency in meeting the NDAA 2010, which requires the past accounting community to have the capability and capacity to support 200 identifications of missing service members from World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam, and the Cold War. This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102 (a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to publish a solicitation no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the solicitation will be issued as sole source requirement.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this new radiation spectroscopy technique. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Various industries including nuclear, medical, and non-proliferation, have been using radiation spectroscopic analysis for decades. Despite its wide use, this technology has always struggled to provide accurate spectroscopy measurements for their applications. Efforts have been made, and continue, to improve the mathematical models for peak-fitting and subsequent analysis but the core concept of spectroscopy remains the same. Conventional methods commonly take many days to perform because of the substantial human factor involved in the analysis, just for the analysis to be inaccurate. All of these factors contribute to an increase in the financial and time expense, which leads user to either accept lower quality results, or forgo measurements all together. Description:?? ?Researchers at INL have developed a new method for spectroscopy that relies on networks of nonlinear, hierarchical learning functions like those used for image-classification. This process can identify and quantify the presence of radioisotopes by processing collected radiation spectra using advanced machine learning. Improvements in machine learning capabilities make it possible to design a technique which allows the computer to act in a similar fashion to an expert scientist analyzing a radiation spectrum. This method would not only substantially improve the capabilities of radiation spectra analysis but would also reduce or even eliminate the human factor involved with the conventional approach. Benefits:??? ?????? Using machine learning immunizes this method from uncertainties introduced by improper peak fitting or template matching involved in traditional methods. The results can be inferred in real time by a single forward pass of the trained network of learning functions, rather than a two-step collect, then analyze process like traditional methods. Real time analysis substantially reduces the time required to obtain the desired results from measurements. Applications:?? Any radiation spectroscopic analysis including, but not limited to: Neutron Gamma Ray X-ray Development Status:? TRL 3. Proof-of-concept has been completed via a prototype experiment.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this melt wire array fabrication technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????The harsh environment inside nuclear reactors makes it a challenge for a variety of materials form fuels to structural materials for their operations. Melt wires are a passive sensing technique to determine peak temperatures during a nuclear test under harsh radiation environment. Melt wire capsules are used by evaluating (during post irradiation examination) whether a melt wire melted. Currently, up to five wires can be placed in a single capsule. This yields some level of temperature resolution, but the manufacturing process is difficult and time consuming, while evaluating the wires during PIE is not easy. INL?s technology seeks to improve temperature resolution, add spatial resolution, and make both manufacturing and evaluation simple. Description:??? Researchers at INL have invented a technique to manufacture encapsulated melt wire chips for use in reactors via advanced printing techniques. The miniaturized melt wire sensors with two millimeters in diameter is capable of multiple melt wires in a single chip. The graded compositions allow for control over the melting temperatures of the wires and a level of spatial resolution for the temperature measurement. Evaluation of the melt arrays can be made electrically by incorporating printed pins into the substrate between adjacent wires and measuring the resistance between them. ? Benefits:??? ??????

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize the control drum system. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Nuclear reactors are generally large and thus the size of their flux control mechanisms (e.g., shutdown rods, control drums) have extensive volume which to occupy. The volume allows these mechanisms to be long, thus allowing component accessibility and displacing sensitive parts from the reactor environment (flux and thermal). However, microreactors do not supply this luxury of larger volumes or associated weight allowances and thus these mechanisms require a more compact, yet still accessible and environment tolerant, solution. ????????????????????????? Microreactors have a large breath of applications (electric power generation, hydrogen production, etc.) particularly in isolated environments. A multitude of technologies are being devised and each present their own system requirements including the mechanical control system?s abilities to effectively function in a restricted volume while also accommodating a wide range of conditions. Many of these control systems are devised specifically to the system in question and lack the flexibility to tune the various required performance features to complement the system needs (e.g., motion response times, torque requirements, shielding etc.). Description:?? ?Researchers at INL have developed a new control drum system design that employs a cage-like structure to efficiently use its components to achieve un-obvious, dual purpose functions. These functions allow it to be compact (volume/weight constraints), accessible (maintenance and control communication), thermally compatible (rails also act as thermal dissipaters), and flux compatible (intermediate platforms also act as shield agents). Benefits:??? ?????? Compact solution Efficiently utilizes its components to accommodate thermal, flux, structural, controls, and mechanical considerations. Flexibility allows one to readily adjust configuration. Provides additional distance between the hazard source (e.g. reactor flux, heat, ect.) and sensitive electronics. Allows for additional platforms that can improve shielding or employ additional components to influence mechanical performance. Operates as a readily implementable and replaceable unit and does not require intricate disassembly although individual capacity components are still readily accessible for performance optimization tuning and maintenance. Simple features allow for rapid manual or simple remote attachment/detachment methods. Allows separation between safety related (SR) and non-safety related (NSR) components, which enables efficient development of a robust control solution. Applications:?? Microreactors, particularly in isolated environments. General rotation motion systems with integrated tunable clutching, limits, continuous output position indication, damping, torque energy capture, and rapid passive homing. Development Status:? TRL 4.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this thermal property measurement instrument. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??????? Rapid design and development of new materials for use in defense, energy, and electronics applications is increasingly dependent on high-throughput sample characterization. Large sets of material characterization data is necessary not only to make classical material optimization decisions but also to feed modern material design tools that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence. This technology, developed by researchers at INL, offers a new way to capture thermal properties of materials while the sample is in the chamber of multi-analytical materials analysis tools. Capturing thermal properties in a spatially localized manner in concert with direct evaluation of microstructures is not currently possible using state-of-the-art instruments. This instrument is designed as an add-on for currently operating materials analysis tools. Description:??? This technology is a compact, solid state, ultra-high vacuum compatible optical instrument designed to measure thermal properties in multi-analytical environments (e.g. TOF-SIMS, FIB, SEM, etc.). This solid-state instrument delivers laser light to the instrument head in a contained fashion using optical fibers. It is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum environments commonly encountered in multi-analytical materials characterization tools such as scanning electron microscopes. This technology allows for operating analytical tools to be retrofitted with new diagnostic capabilities for measuring thermal properties and new multi-analytical tools to be designed with this technology in mind. INL?s technology enables rapid and highly-spatially correlated measurements of multiple material properties. Research so far have measured material thermal properties key to applications ranging from nuclear fuel to turbine thermal barrier coatings, to power electronics. The ability to directly correlate these properties with highly local material microstructure will greatly reduce uncertainty in the understanding of structure-property relationships for materials under development. Benefits:??? ?????? Compatible with analytical systems from multiple major manufacturers. Allows for far greater variability of optical methods to be deployed compared to single-measure-type instruments currently deployed. Allows spatial mapping of thermal properties directly, rather than spatial measurements of resulting temperature fields. Applications:?? ? Materials evaluation and testing Rapid thermal analysis ?

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Inscopix nVue miniature microscope and its associated hardware for dual-color in vivo fluorescence imaging in the brains of behaving animals. This equipment will be critical for the central mission of the Integrative Neuroscience Section (INS) to study the neural basis of normal and disordered learning and memory processes. We are requesting this item to expand our capacity perform in vivo imaging experiments to assess cell-type specific function and connectivity in mouse brain. The nVue system allows for the simultaneous fluorescence imaging in two colors (green and red). This item is only available through Inscopix, and this particular upgrade is only available to us at the listed pricing because we acquired a different Inscopix microscope in the past. Also, we require this particular upgraded microscope to be consistent with our previous research using the previous model for scientific continuity. Purpose: Research in the INS probes the neural circuit basis of normal working memory, and characterizes the neural circuit and working memory dysfunction in mouse models of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. INS members use in vivo physiology to record the function of discrete cells and circuits in freely moving mice. INS focuses on understanding the neural computations within, and circuit-level interactions between, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and thalamus of the mouse. The ability to conduct optical imaging of fluorescent indicators of neural activity in the brains of freely moving rodents is required for the research conducted in the INS. The nVue platform includes: 1. nVue microscope (fully integrated and assembled for immediate use) 2. DAQ box (allows for seamless communication with an external hardware device and coordinates or controls multiple devices during an experiment) 3. Inscopix Data Acquisition Software (software includes device control for two imaging LEDs in dual dynamic, dynamic-static, neurotransmitter, and blood flow imaging modes) 4. Commutator support (fully compatible with the Inscopix Commutator, an active, motorized solution for cable management during rodent behavior) 5. Inscopix Data Processing Software (software GUI is user-friendly, with options for customization) 6. ProViewTM Implant Kit (a specialized attachment device to hold lens during surgical procedures, includes stereotax rod, screw, adjustment tool, and instructions) 7. 5 baseplate covers, 1 dummy microscope, and support for Integrated ProView lens probes with pre-aligned baseplates (available in a variety of diameters or lengths of GRIN lens; straight or prism can be specified by the user) 8.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. ?It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. ?Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. ?No award will be made as a result of this notice. ?The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. ?This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background: ?NCATS has become a key partner in the Antiviral Program for Pandemics (APP), a multi-agency initiative that includes NIAID and BARDA, to accelerate antiviral development through early discovery and preclinical development of safe and effective oral antivirals. The initial priority for the APP is to develop treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, with the program expanding to address other virus families with pandemic potential. NCATS will apply its proficiency in drug discovery and development and its cutting-edge technologies to fill critical needs of the APP, such as (i) target validation, (ii) high-throughput screening (HTS) for drug starting points, (iii) medicinal chemistry for lead optimization, and (iv) preclinical, investigational new drug (IND)-enabling development. APP chemists within DPI are tasked with the discovery and development potential small molecule antiviral treatments for a range of viruses that have pandemic potential. In order to meet the increased demand for sample purification and analysis, the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) needs to improve throughput and expand capabilities through procurement of additional instrumentation and equipment, as well as the application of new technologies. Purpose and Objectives: Of all the chromatographic techniques and methods that the ACC has available, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a technique that is not current employed for the analysis and purification of compounds synthesized by DPI medicinal chemists. SFC is a variant of normal-phase HPLC where supercritical CO2 is used as the mobile phase along with a cosolvent to modify polarity. The unique properties of the supercritical fluid enable chemical separations not readily possible with other chromatographic techniques. With the understanding that a limited number of chromatographic techniques cannot possibly purify all compounds, the ACC sees the incorporation of SFC into the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform as a means to expand purification capabilities and resolve operational issues. A bottleneck in the workflow is the removal of solvent after purification, which is a time-consuming process dependent on the volume and boiling point of the solvent. As we move to a more automated platform, a reduction in solvent removal time is needed to increase throughput and cycle time. SFC offers a convenient solution as CO2 is easily removed through rapid evaporation leaving behind pure material. An additional benefit of SFC is an increased sample load injection while still maintaining good separation efficiency enabling faster throughput or larger amounts of material. As such, the ACC is looking to expand its chromatography capabilities with the acquisition of a Waters ACQUITY UltraPerformance C2 SFC instrument with QDa for analytical analysis of compounds synthesized by APP, ETB, TDB, and CGB medicinal chemists within DPI. Project requirements: ?Waters ACQUITY UltraPerformance C2 SFC instrument with QDa?

In order to meet the increased demand for sample purification and analysis, the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) needs to improve throughput and expand capabilities through procurement of additional instrumentation and equipment, as well as the application of new technologies. Purpose and Objectives: The ACC provides analytical chemistry services involving the isolation, purification, identification, and analysis of therapeutic modalities for targeted disease states. This is accomplished through the development and usage of the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform. This workflow employs both Gilson and Waters semi-preparative liquid chromatography systems with a selection of preparative columns capable of purifying a wide range of small molecules and peptides. The Gilson platform utilizes UV-directed sample collection while the Waters platform employs both UV- and mass-directed detection and collection. The current Gilson purification system in the Bldg A Chemistry lab is over 10 yrs old and has been experiencing more severe malfunctions with increasing frequency. This has contributed to a greater backlog of samples and a decrease in productivity. The obsolete instrument needs to be replaced due to the increased service needs, longer down times, and an observed reduction in product recovery amounts. As such, the ACC requires the acquisition of a replacement purification system, specifically a Waters AutoPurification System with SQD2 MS Detector, which is the same Waters instrument employed in the Bldg C Chemistry lab. By utilizing the same instrumentation across all labs, we enable greater standardization and efficiency of the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform. Additionally, the redundancy of Waters AutoPurification systems will provide increased consistency with purification results, as well as allow better cross-coverage due to instrument familiarity by the chromatography chemists. The new purification system will provide higher robustness, greater performance, and increased capabilities for the purification of compounds synthesized by APP, ETB, TDB, and CGB medicinal chemists within DPI.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background:? Neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer?s disease, are diseases that greatly affect patients? quality of life and they often require the need of caregivers. The incidence of these devastating diseases is continuously increasing, affecting large number of elderly individuals and presenting an ever greater burden on society and caregivers. Currently, drugs that could effectively treat these diseases do not exist. Moreover, currently, the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases is mostly possible at their advanced stages, when symptoms are already pronunced and affect patients? daily functioning. Disease detection at earlier, especially, preclinical, stages would allow NIA to test preventive interventions, combine treatments and lifestyle adjusments that could potentially delay disease onset and slow down disease progression. Extracellular Vesicle are membranous nanoparticles (with sizes from 50 nm ? 300 nm) secreted by all healthy and diseased cells, including neurons in neurodegenerative diseases. NIA has pioneered the use of Extracellular Vesicle biomarkers isolated from blood. To be able to effectively isolate Extracellular Vesicle to discover novel biomarkers, NIA must seek out novel and advanced techologies. The field of Extracellular Vesicle biomarkers is fairly new is but developing at very fast pace, because of its tremendeus potential in disease prognosis and diagnosis. Regarding the detection of Extracellular Vesicles in blood and other biofluids and their isolation, NIA often finds currently available technologies not sensitive enough and even obsolete. The required Cell Sorter with nano-scale capabilities presents this next step that is needed in NIA?s current reaserch. NIA requires superior and advanced capabilities that are much needed by the labs and other NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP) labs investigating Extracellular Vesicles for their role in aging and age-associated diseases. Purpose and Objectives: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) investigates biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases found in Extracellular Vesicles (particles 50-150 nm in size) and isolated from patients? plasma. In order to separate, validate and characterize isolated Extracellular Vesicles, NIA requires an instrument that is capable of separating particles of that size and sorting Extracellular Vesicles based on fluorescent signal tags. As a laboratory that has pioneered the development of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease using Extracellular Vesicles of neuronal origin, this instrument is needed for the next (more advanced) level of Alzheimer's disease diagnostics. Project requirements: Benchtop Cell Sorter with the following salient characteristics: Violet side scatter configuration: Option to configure detector array to collect side scatter signal from Violet (405 nm) laser. The configured channel (VSSC) can be utilized to better resolve nanoparticles. Scatter resolution: Scatter performance optimized for resolving nanoparticles (nm resolution range). Dynamic laser options for the excitation of multiple markers in single extracellular vesicles simultaneously: Violet, 405 nm Blue, 488 nm Yellow, 561 nm Red, 638 nm Dynamic array of band pass filters for the detection of multiple markers in single extracellular vesicles simultaneously: 405/10 675/30 450/45 690/50 525/40 710/50 585/42 712/25 610/20 780/60 660/10 High sensitivity in main channels used for the detection of fluorescent extracellular vesicles: FITC: <30 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-FITC) from the 488 nm laser. PE: <10 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-PE) from the 561 nm laser. APC: <25 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-APC) from the 638 nm laser. Low sample flow rates (10 ?L/min) for the detection of single extracellular vesicles under non-swarming conditions. Automated maintenance, analysis and sorting setup reducing the time of experimentation and allowing usage by researchers with no prior experience with flow cytometry after basic training. Sorting of scarce sub-populations of extracellular vesicles from complex biofluids will require long sorting times during which the instrument will be running unattended. Hence, the sorter should monitor sorting stability and protect the sorted sample when a clog is detected or if the sorting droplet is unstable. Also, the instrument should be capable of controlling the temperature to protect the sample during long sorting times.? Long sorting times will result in sorted samples with high volume. Hence, the sorter should have collection devices of high-volume capacity (e.g. multiple 5-15 mL tube holders). The instrument should be capable of sorting multiple sub-populations simultaneously (preferably more than three) with high purity. Quantity: 1 Delivery Date: 60 days after receipt of award.

The statutory authority for this acquisition is 41 USC 3304(a)(1); FAR 13.106-1(b). ***** Sole source determination is based on the need to acquire one (1) tunable telecom laser with high-speed servo. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Physical Measurements Laboratory (PML), Optomechanics Group in the Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, we do research involving photonic crystals for optomechanics.? This research involves designing and testing these optomechanical photonic crystals in order to optimize their optical and mechanical properties, most notably the optical reflectivity and the mechanical quality factor.? These optomechanical photonic crystals have applications including small force sensing, accelerometry, vacuum measurement, and quantum technologies, all of which are pursued at NIST.? In order to evaluate and make use of the optomechanical photonics crystals that we design and fabricate, we probe and drive them with laser light.? We design these photonic crystals to work at optical wavelengths in the telecom band (roughly 1500 nm ? 1600 nm) and use lasers to drive them and build these crystals into cavities with linewidths as low as 200 kHz and aim for even lower linewidth.? The cavities are probed with tunable, narrow-linewidth lasers and we lock the laser wavelength to the cavities by means of electronics.? The Division is in need of a newer tunable telecom-wavelength laser with a narrower linewidth and the ability for fast servo control in order to lock the laser to dynamic, narrow-linewidth optical cavities.? This is necessary to do research that is not limited by a laser source that dates to 2010.? The ?special? element here is the ability to control the laser frequency very rapidly in order to ?lock? the laser frequency with feedback to a rapidly-changing resonance of an optical cavity.? The linewidth of our optical cavities has become smaller and smaller, making the issue of locking a laser to the cavity resonances ever more challenging as our newest photonic-crystal cavities are so good that we are not able to lock our lasers to them at all. The key requirement is a 50 MHz bandwidth for control of the laser frequency; in addition, sophisticated computer-controlled electronics with the lowest possible latency times are critical for adequate servo performance.? Toptica is the only company that can offer a bandwidth of 50 MHz, signal latency below 10 ns, and a computer controller with three integrators and two differentiators.? Toptica Photonics, Inc is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the equipment that meets the required minimum specifications. *****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 ? Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. *****A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.? Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. ? *****No solicitation package will be issued.? This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing before the response date of this notice. Only responses received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on June 7, 2022 will be considered by the government. ?Responses shall be submitted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov or forest.crumpler@nist.gov"

The unique patented technology allows investigators in determining the cell morphology, cell health, movement and function of cell models, and in studying complex cell-cell interactions from hours to days over time by live cell imaging and analysis data in real-time. The automation of the IncyCyte S3 system is an required by the investigators as it allows acquiring and analyzing phase-contrast and fluorescence images of the cells without disturbing the cells or removing the cells from the incubator. The IncuCyte suite of applications will be used in areas of oncology, immune-oncology, immunology, neuroscience, aging, diabetes, drug discovery, and nanomedicine. Using the system, investigating various aspects of cell functions and behavior and response to treatment is feasible that could lead to developing novel therapeutics, and new areas of research. The equipment s unique design has a microscope with fixed sample stage that offers uninterrupted incubation of a range of cell types - from proliferating tumor cells to non-adherent immune cells to sensitive primary cells. The system is versatile and has interchangeable trays to accommodate tissue culture flasks, dishes, or multi-well plates. The IncuCyte S3 system allows the visualization (by phase-contrast and fluorescence) and monitoring of cell health and proliferation (eg: cell counting, apoptosis, tumor spheroid, cell-cycle, etc.); cell function (eg: phagocytosis, NETosis, angiogenesis, immune cell killing, neuronal activity, antibody internalization, etc.); cell movement and morphology (eg: scratch wound assay, cell migration and invasion, neurite outgrowth, immune cell activation, etc.); binding of biological and non-biological materials (drug, nanoparticle, cell-particle interaction, antibody binding to cell, etc.); measurement of receptor-mediated binding and entry into cells (nanoparticles, quantum-dots, virus, bacteria, metals, antibodies, etc.); and intracellular localization and trafficking (siRNA, plasmid DNA, nanoparticles, virus, bacteria, spores, etc.). All of these biological and functional activities can be captured in real-time using the time-lapse system and the data presented visually in image format and numerically in graphical format. The IncuCyte S3 system also includes the requisite software system for generating customer-specific protocols. Since the protocols can be automated, once the experiment in particular the time-lapse imaging starts, the user can walk-away from the instrument while the samples are being processed, which frees the user to perform other experiments or analyses. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any responsible source who can provide an equivalent product with these features described above may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than May 23th, 4:30PM, EST.

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor the website(s) for any information that may pertain to this RFI. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and shall not be returned. 1.0 PURPOSE OF THIS RFI This RFI constitutes market research to help PM LI2S-MC, along with members of Deputy Commandant for Capability Development and Integration (DC, CD&I) and Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (DC, I&L) to solicit experience and input from industry to inform development of a long-range (FY26 + ~10 yrs) strategic technology requirements to modernize current Logistics Command and Control (LOGC2) capabilities and plan for future additions and enhancements. The scope of eventual potential contract(s) will include replacing outdated, interim logistics systems with deployable front-end capabilities to retrieve and transact with data from the Global Combat Support Services-Marine Corps (GCSS-MC); enable and expand supply and maintenance requests in a tactical environment; and plan for replacement of the GCSS-MC system by fiscal year 2032 (FY32). The results of this, and potential future, RFIs and industry days will inform a full-scope Capability-Based Analysis and subsequent Acquisition Program Strategies that will provide the basis for delivering LOGC2 capabilities acquisition in FY26 and beyond. It is anticipated that access to the following Government information systems will be required in the performance of this contract: Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE), Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) module in PIEE, and Government Furnished Property (GFP) module in PIEE. This RFI allows potential offerors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its requirements and eventual acquisition strategy. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS QUESTIONS PM LI2S-MC may not respond to questions, as this announcement is for market research purposes only. However, any questions submitted may aid the PM LI2S-MC in the planning phase of the procurement. Answers will be provided at the LOGC2 Industry Day and posted to the original GPE after the Industry Day event. Any questions should be submitted via email to MCSC_PMLI2S@usmc.mil utilizing the questions submission file provided with the RFI (Microsoft Office 2010 or newer format).

It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure that submission is timely. RFI submissions may be submitted before 10:00 a.m. ET on Monday, 6 June 2022. Proprietary Data The Government may use information received from this RFI to establish future requirements. Offerors deciding to submit competition sensitive or proprietary information bear sole responsibility for marking the information for appropriate safeguarding. RFI RESPONSES Scope of Technical and Programmatic Challenge The approved GCSS-MC system requirements date back to FY 2003, and describe capabilities suited to the existing Marine Corps organization and business system requirements. The intent was, and still is, that GCSS-MC would deliver a comprehensive system that would replace legacy and stand-alone logistics applications with a single source of truth.? While formal requirements exist, they were not informed by a Concept of Operations describing USMC logistics ?in the fight,? and they were developed prior to the existence of cloud and information technology ?as a service? capabilities. Additionally, the systems to be replaced have minimal or no formal requirements, and those that exist are, at best, requirements traceability matrices that were devised to support awarding of support and sustainment contracts. The Deputy Commandant for Capabilities Development and Integration (CD&I), supported by PM LI2S and Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (I&L), has initiated a Critical Data Analysis (CDA) and Logistics Enterprise Information Architecture (LOG EIA) to support near- and long-term requirements to deliver information technology (IT) capabilities in support of Marines fighting the Near-Peer competitor in degraded environments as well as modernizing the Marine Corps APSR and Supporting Establishment operations. It is the intent that the CDA and LOG EIA will be enduring documents, to be reviewed regularly and updated as needed, to reflect evolving operations concepts and data exchange needs. Later in FY22, CD&I will embark on developing a Concept(s) of Operations and Capability-Based Assessment(s) that will detail one or more capability needs based on the results of the CDA and LOG EIA. The combined CDA, CBA and LOG EIA will provide the basis for FY26 budget initiatives to modernize LOGC2 IT, which the Program Office envisions pursuing a postmodern ERP strategy to enhance current capabilities until full replacement of GCSS-MC (FY32-35 timeframe) begins. Recognizing that industry has already faced and addressed many of the challenges ahead of the Marine Corps, information and recommendations to support Program Objective Memorandum, FY26 (POM 26) initiatives and supporting Acquisition planning are being solicited in this RFI. Page Restriction(s) There is no page restriction associated with this RFI. An executive summary of five pages or less should accompany each submission. Responses may include advertising or marketing information. Executive Summary (5 pages or less) Provide your company name, point of contact (POC), business size (large or small), socio-economic status for all North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes you operate under, Seaport NxG contract number, and/or any applicable GSA schedule numbers. Provide a capability statement based on the context of the technical challenges described in paragraphs 2.3.1 and well as 2.3.4. Provide any relevant material illustrating the company?s experience, including findings from referenced technology modernization or business process reengineering efforts. Technology and Technical Approach The Government intends to retire legacy non-GCSS-MC logistics information systems and replace them with modernized front-end capabilities that can access and transact with GCSS-MC in various tactical and non-tactical environments. In particular, the Marine Corps is interested in findings and recommendations relating to distribution, warehousing, networks, and transportation capacity planning PM LI2S-MC invites your assessment of the current environment and solicits white papers based on direct experience and lessons learned to describe the following. Technical approaches to modernizing large Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems using application program interfaces (APIs) as well as containerized, cloud, and platform/infrastructure/software as a service constructs. Technical considerations to help inform calculation of edge compute and mobile platforms in an austere, potentially disconnected, tactical environment. Areas of consideration for Business Process Engineering/Reengineering in support of technology insertion. Planning and contracting for Dev/Sec/Ops pipelines that can be established quickly to meet emerging requirements or budget ?plus-ups.? Considerations to ensure Acquisition and Lifecycle Support cost estimates are comprehensive, including affordability alternatives. Areas of technology, performance or other trades pace to support development of budget initiatives and associated scenarios. Considerations and approaches for eventual replacement (FY32) of GCSS-MC in its current form with a modern, containerized/cloud-enabled system of systems that can support operations from a well-connected Supporting Establishment to a disconnected tactical environment. RFI Feedback (No page restriction) Was the combination of this RFI and the information delivered at Industry Day sufficient to devise a response? Are there any objectives not described in this RFI that would enhance the content and relevance of industry responses? Are there potential technical approaches that we should consider in addition to those detailed in paragraph 2.3.4, subparagraph i. What performance risks should be considered when articulating requirements? If the Government determines additional RFIs and/or industry days are warranted to support further requirement development, what would you recommend they be? INDUSTRY DAY The PM LI2S-MC will host an industry day on Tuesday, 3 May 2022, at Quantico Corporate Center, just outside of Marine Corps Base Quantico (MCBQ), Virginia. All interested parties are highly encouraged to attend. The intent of the industry day is to deliver a comprehensive description of current LOGC2 capabilities and challenges and to present the Program Manager?s vision for LOGC2 capability modernization planning and describe the information and recommendations being solicited from industry.
