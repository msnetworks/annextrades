Completion of this process will allow your business to participate in future County business opportunities.  It also provides your ability to maintain your data as your business grows or changes.  There is a two-step process to register as a vendor; one for bidding opportunities and a second to set your company up to receive purchase orders and payment.  So, bear with us as we help open the window of opportunity for you.

The first step is to get set you up to receive electronic bid notifications.  The County utilizes the services of Public Purchase, a third-party electronic bidding software that allows vendors to register for specific goods and services they offer.  This would be done using NIGP (National Institution of Governmental Purchasing) codes as the commodity part number.  Once you are registered with Public Purchase, you will receive e-mail notifications of upcoming bidding opportunities for the items you signed up for.  You will also be able to view all the open bids, electronically respond to the bids and see bid results once they are awarded.  Additionally, you would receive notices of any addendums to those bids as well as have the opportunity to post questions and receive answers pertaining to that bid.  All questions and answers are posted on-line so that all bidders have access to the same information regarding the bid.

There is NO CHARGE to register and utilize this service for the County of Riverside.  Public Purchase has other services available for a fee, but that is solely at your discretion and not required to do business with the County of Riverside."

A current list of such Excluded States and Outlying Areas is maintained at https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ End of Update Process for Contractor Entry into FAA Facilities I.? Effective Date This COVID-19 attestation process is effective immediately. II.? Definitions A.? Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Facility or Operational Location: Workspace for which FAA has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, requisition, or condemnation. B.? Contractor: Firms/entities providing services and/or supplies to FAA under a Federal contract award. C.? Contractor Employees: Individual employees of the contractor entity performing work under a FAA contract award. D.? On-Site: Physically being present at a FAA facility or operational location. III.? Background The FAA has updated its current operating procedures in response to the updated Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guidance and the July 29, 2021 guidance issued by the Administration?s Safer Workforce Task Force concerning COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Agency Model Safety Principles (https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov). The country is still in the midst of a global pandemic and therefore, Government-wide guidance continues to evolve, including recently issued guidance regarding enhanced mask wearing and testing for Federal employees, on-site contractors, and visitors. To this end, it is still highly encouraged that any contractor employee who can perform their work on a contract in support of the Department without negative impact to the mission, be afforded the flexibility to telework to the maximum extent practicable. While it is understood that many contractors must perform work at FAA facilities, compliance with the new guidance and any future changes may be required. IV.? Authorities A.?Executive Order (EO) No. 13991 ? Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask Wearing, January 20, 2021 B.??Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo No. M-21-15 ? COVID-19 Safe Federal workplace: Agency Model Safety Principles, January 24, 2021 C.??OMB Memo No. M-21-25 ? Integrating Planning for a Safe Increased Return of Federal Employees and Contractors to Physical Workplaces with Post-Reentry Personnel Policies and work Environment, June 10, 2021 V.? Policy and Procedures 1.? Using the OMB-approved Certification of Vaccination Form?(https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf), contractor employees who are scheduled to report to FAA facilities shall attest to their employer as to their vaccination status. Using the information provided by individual employees, contractor firms shall attest to the vaccination status of their employees who will be physically on-site at a FAA facility. Contractor firms must communicate to their assigned FAA Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) that all of their contractor employees reporting to FAA facilities are following this guidance and are either vaccinated or are testing as specified below. On-site contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide their vaccination status to their employer are required to obtain a negative COVID-19 test no older than 72 hours to enter FAA facilities. Under either scenario, FAA CORs will rely on the attestation of the contractor firm. Testing requirements only affect on-site contractor personnel who are unvaccinated or who decline to provide their vaccination status. CORs shall not collect or store information on the vaccination status of any individual contractor employee. That is the responsibility of the contractor firm. 2.? On-site contractor employees shall also follow all signage posted in FAA facilities or operational locations regarding masking and comply with all instructions/requirements by Federal Protective Service officers and/or facility managers. Failure to comply with signage and local facility requirements will result in removal from the facility. While localized facility guidance takes precedence, individuals can monitor areas of high transmission via the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker County View (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view). 3.? Contractor personnel should carry their completed OMB-approved Certification of Vaccination form and/or current negative COVID test results with them at all times when at a FAA facility or operational location and be prepared to show those documents to any security guard or other government official if asked. The government will not retain any of the contractor forms. VI.? Questions Any questions or concerns not addressed in the online FAQ or concerns regarding this Directive shall be submitted to 9-AFN-ACQ-EM@faa.gov."

The National Center For Advancing Transltional Sciences (NCATS), Rockville, MD?intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue an order with Eurofins Panlabs, Inc.under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This purchase is for Lab Testing Services, Evaluation of Binding Affinity for twelve Lead D3 Antagonists in D2L and D3 Radioligand Binding Assays, IC50 determination. TDB at NCATS in collaboration with the investigators at NIDA has embarked on a journey to find novel D3R antagonists while displaying significant selectivity from the highly homologous D2 receptors. Working on the bitopic ligands identified by earlier investigations, the team has identified several lead molecules that display around a 1000-fold selectivity over D2R in the binding assays. These lead molecules occupy an orthosteric binding site (OBS) at D3R and connect to a secondary binding pocket (SBP), via a 4-carbon linker, responsible for achieving selectivity amongst the dopamine receptor subtypes. The lead molecules from this series, identified by the team, has displayed efficacy in various rat and non-human primate models of addiction and are being considered for development. In this study, we will be evaluating D2/D3 selectivity for twelve lead antagonists in the in-vitro radio ligand binding assays. D2L and D3 Human Dopamine GPCR binding assays were chosen for this purpose. The ability of the new antagonist leads to inhibit the binding of the radio labeled ligand will be measured and reported. These assays will be performed at 5 antagonist concentrations and the IC50 will be reported. This data will help guide the in-vivo campaign for these lead antagonists. Award is subject to approval of the Sole Source Justification.

General guidance may be found in FAR 9.505; however, this guidance is not all-inclusive.?

For example, a potential conflict may arise if former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror may have gained access to nonpublic information about a competitor through participation in previous or ongoing performance or during the solicitation development/source selection process associated with this competitive procurement, and then participates in the formation of the Offeror?s proposal.? Other potential conflicts of interest may arise where either the former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror under this competitive procurement set the ground rules for competition; for example, by drafting specifications or assisting in the drafting of the statement of work. General guidance may be found in FAR 3.101 and 9.505; however, this guidance is not all-inclusive.? (c)? If an Offeror identifies a potential conflict of interest that exists at any tier, that Offeror is requested to notify the Contracting Officer within 14 days of the date of this solicitation.?

The Government may independently verify the information received from the Offeror.? The requirement to identify potential conflicts of interest as outlined herein continues until contract award.?

“Understanding the depth of youth homelessness is challenging in a rural state,” said Dave Flohr, North Dakota Housing Finance Agency (NDHFA) executive director. “Through the YHDP, we are committed to ending youth homelessness in North Dakota.”

The ND CoC received a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to support selected communities in the development and implementation of a coordinated community approach to preventing and ending youth homelessness.

The population to be served by the program is youth experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of homelessness, including unaccompanied and pregnant or parenting youth, where no member of the household is older than 24 years.

Eligible applications include nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, instrumentalities of local governments, and public housing agencies. To learn more about the YHDP, visit ndcontinuumofcare.org. The application deadline is June 8, 2022.

NDHFA is the Collaborative Applicant for the state’s CoC, a communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness. The program provides funding to support efforts to end homelessness, promotes access to and for effective utilization of programs, and optimizes the self-sufficiency of individuals and families experiencing homelessness.

NDHFA is a self-supporting and mission-driven state agency dedicated to making housing affordable for all North Dakotans. The North Dakota Industrial Commission, consisting of Governor Doug Burgum as chairman, Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring and Attorney General Drew H. Wrigley, oversees the agency."

DEC anticipates signing contracts with up to three firms under the terms of this RFP. The state will be divided into three regions – northwest, northeast, and south. Each contractor can bid on one or more regions. We anticipate conducting 15 needs assessments with these funds across the entire state, however, the actual number may be larger depending upon demand. The number of MHC needs assessments within each region will be determined based on documented demand. Project locations will be finalized before the final contract is signed by the chosen contractor(s) and DEC. When submitting proposals for a particular region, contractors should expect to receive up to 15 needs assessment assignments per region. No work is guaranteed in a particular region; however, DEC expects projects to be located in more than one region of the state based on the known needs of MHCs. Up to $40,000 is available for each MHC needs assessment, which includes a PER and an EID, and in their proposals, contractors should discuss what value they can achieve working within that budget. Please note that payment for individual project authorizations will be for completed performance milestones established by the DEC in a project authorization approval.

The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance.

Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or issuance thereof. Issued By: United States Department of Education, Federal Student Aid (FSA), Washington, DC. Proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS): 54151 IT Support The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses to provide ongoing support of FSA?s Enterprise Project Portfolio Management system. Please refer to the ?Scope? and ?Information Requested? sections of this RFI for specific information that should be detailed in any capability statement submission. This Request for Information includes: Draft EPPM O&M Support Services Task description DESCRIPTION 1.1 Background Federal Student Aid (FSA), an office of the U.S. Department of Education (ED), plays a central and essential role in America's postsecondary education community. FSA's core mission is to ensure that all eligible Americans can benefit from federal financial assistance including grants, loans, and work study programs, for education beyond high school. To manage federal student aid programs, approximately $1.8 billion per year in discretionary funding is appropriated to FSA for student aid administration. FSA?s Enterprise Project Portfolio Management system (EPPM) is an on-premises application software. The software is used by over 200 FSA staff to support FSA?s budget formulation and execution processes and procedures, which are managed by the FSA Finance Directorate?s Budget Group. Users include FSA Program Managers, Budget Analysts, management, and contractor support staff. EPPM has been used to collect and consolidate FSA?s annual student aid administration budget request since 2012. Budget request information, including business case information, scope/objectives, accounting data, monthly request amounts, and supporting documentation are entered by users as part of FSA?s budget formulation annual planning process. Requests are submitted for two years out from the current fiscal year (FY). The system automates the review and approval of over 200 requests, called Budget Initiative Requests (BIRs), through six stage gates, before being consolidated for inclusion in FSA?s budget request to ED, ED?s request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Congressional Justification submitted to Congress. The system also captures FSA budget data for select key formulation milestones including the President?s Budget and final enacted budget. EPPM also captures business case information, objectives, risks, constraints, and software and licensing information for 35 FSA systems. As part of the budget execution process, EPPM is used to manage FSA?s current year spend plan once the Student Aid Administration account is appropriated by Congress through a Continuing Resolution or an appropriations act. Changes to the spend plan are executed through Budget Change Requests (BCRs). EPPM automates the routing of each request through the review process and updates spend plans once a request is approved. EPPM also provides budget analysts with key reports necessary to analyze FSA?s budget portfolio and reconcile FSA?s budget against its annual appropriation. 1.2 Current System Environment EPPM is a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software package that integrates Microsoft Project Server 2016, Microsoft SharePoint 2016, and UMT360 Financials. EPPM was originally deployed in March 2012 and was last updated in June 2021 under Release 6.0. No new major releases are anticipated during the term of the anticipated contract. Required support is related to the configured application. Actual maintenance of the hardware infrastructure and some software infrastructure is performed by other vendors on behalf of FSA. The EPPM application is one of several applications running on a server network maintained by FSA?s Employee Enterprise Business Collaboration team and Next Generation Data Center. FSA is currently evaluating alternative budget formulation and execution systems. Acquisition and implementation of a new system may result in EPPM system retirement during the period of performance of the anticipated contract. 1.3 Scope The primary objective of this activity is to identify sources available to provide FSA with ongoing support as described in the Task Areas below. Task Area 1, System Operations and Maintenance Support, includes, but is not limited to, the following: Support EPPM upgrades, updates, patches and fixes Testing Maintain system documentation Change requests Application maintenance and troubleshooting Monitor daily EPPM Operations activity and system performance Security Reporting Help Desk Select system administrator activities Task Area 2, Support FSA?s Budget Processes, includes, but is not limited to, the following: Budget Formulation ?

OFPM has a need for an additional custom risk scorecard integrated within the existing CreditLens software that will be used to accurately evaluate the risk of loan default and ultimately determine the potential for an expected credit loss using a Probability of Default (PD) model and Loss Given Default (LGD) framework using underlying historical DFC default and recovery data from CreditLens. This custom scorecard, known as the Mission Transaction Unit (MTU) scorecard can only be developed and implemented by Moody?s, as it will be a custom application integrated into the existing, proprietary CreditLens software."

AAS plans to issue one TO under the VETS 2 Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), which is the only GWAC set aside exclusively for Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). GSA has found the consolidation necessary and justified. The expected benefits do not meet the threshold for substantial benefits identified in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 7.107-2(d) but are critical to mission success in accordance with FAR 7.107-2(e). The CDC?s mission is to protect America from health, safety, and security threats, both foreign and domestic. The agency depends on their telecommunications infrastructure to provide information that protects America from dangerous health threats on a continuous basis. As an information-intensive organization, the CDC?s dependence on their telecommunications infrastructure continues to grow rapidly and is essential to the success of their mission. This infrastructure has a direct impact on CDC?s mission ? it enables the agency to connect with the American public and Americans worldwide as well as universities, research laboratories, hospitals, healthcare organizations, and quarantine stations to share guidance and exchange knowledge on important topics such as COVID-19. A consolidated effort would ensure that CDC?s telecommunications infrastructure would perform at peak levels with no degradation due to poor support of their PBX/telephony services, communications cabling, cellular repeaters, or email/chat/virtual meeting services. The direct support for the CDC?s mission as well as substantial cost savings that will be realized as a result of this consolidated order outweigh any potential negative impacts to small businesses.

Wetlands are diverse and can be difficult for the average person to identify. There is a need to improve public awareness of potential wetland locations throughout the State of Vermont (VT). The Program is working to update the publicly accessible electronic wetland mapping to help people recognize where wetlands are most likely occurring on the landscape and avoid impacts to those wetlands and their 50-foot buffer zone. The updated mapping will also inform the Program’s Wetland Screening Tool and the DEC’s Permit Navigator, which are both important tools for landowners to help them identify potential wetlands on their properties. However, these tools are only helpful if people know to find and use them and understand the limitations of any wetland mapping. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the DEC to gather information to help inform the design, administration, and implementation of a public awareness campaign around knowing about and using wetland mapping and identification tools and increase knowledge around state wetland regulations in anticipation of immediate map updates and updates to span across the next five years.
