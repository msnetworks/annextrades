This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes only. Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? Rather, the purpose of this RFI is to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.? A determination by the Government not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. BACKGROUND: The Air Force (AF) has need to modernize the HVAC Purge/Flush Process and Equipment used to maintain MMIII in addition to the transition to the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ??The AF would like to obtain information to understand if processes and equipment are available and obtainable. The purpose of this RFI is two-fold. The first purpose is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be a full and open competition and/or a total small business set-aside.? The Government is looking at several North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) codes; 238220 HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-condition) contractors or 423730 HVAC equipment merchant wholesales. ?If an alternate NAICS code is recommended, please provide the recommendation in the response.? The AF is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.? The AF requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable, and identify your business status to the identified NAICS code (see the Section labeled ?Responses? for response requirements).? Additionally, please provide any potential teaming arrangements.? Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The second purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about schedule, cost, and other aspects of this potential procurement from the perspectives of development and implementation. DESCRIPTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) maintains ICBM?s in the northern United States. In an effort to establish greater warfighter capabilities multiple systems are capable of initiating ICBM launches. The Brine Chiller Purge is used to ensure the HVAC equipment will be sufficient to sustain MMIII and through the transition to GBSD through acquisition (and modification as needed) of required equipment. The legacy/current process and equipment for evacuating and dehydrating, checking the refrigerant pressure, and reclaiming and servicing the LF and MAF Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-systems are using these available industry parts: Yellow Jacket (PN21012) oil changing pump SPX Robinair Vacuum Pump (PN 15600) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Reclaimer (PN 17800B) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Receiver Tank (PN 17121) The process, in conjunction with using the parts listed above, takes maintenance technicians an average 3-5 days to complete.? A bench checkout on the Brine Chiller is conducted post servicing the Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-system.? CAPABILITIES:? Field and/or Apprentice Technician level and/or skill set Basic HVAC Principle Training focus on ECS and EPA regulation List hazardous and/or flammable materials List of general, specialty, and/or sole source equipment and materials Vacuum operating level maximum must be below and hold below 500 Microns no less than 5-minutes; no minimum level purge or holding requirement Overall timeline for completing process must be less than 3-days with a bench check? process ideally less than but no more than 4 hours (i.e. 2-hours under low heat load and 2-hours under high heat load) Operating procedures and/or user?s manual ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED: Provide a schedule from contract award through qualification and implementation Provide an estimate cost range as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) from contract award through qualification and implementation. RESPONSES: Responsible and capable sources may identify their interest by providing a white paper capability statement (limited to 10 pages) with sufficient information to substantiate respondents have all of the capabilities listed in Capabilities and answering all questions. ?Please see the section for Eligibility Requirement. Government will consider responses to one or all of the purposes depending on company?s capability. ADDITIONAL NOTICES: Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? A determination by the AF not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the AF. ?The AF will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.? ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT: The distribution of the draft specification and top level drawings is limited to contractors with a DD 2345 certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service, Joint Certification Program (1-877-352-2255) and who have a legitimate business purpose. As such, WBS cannot be provided to a contractor without a certification. Contractors who would like to become certified can find the form and instructions at: https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx. Interested parties are advised that certification of a DD Form 2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form as soon as possible is highly recommended.
