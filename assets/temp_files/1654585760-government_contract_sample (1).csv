Description of Requirement Advances in DNA sequencing technology enable scientists to rapidly determine the genomic makeup of various organisms, detect mutations and polymorphisms associated with diseases, define genetic variations of pathogens and their infectivity, reveal patterns of gene expression (transcriptomes), elucidate functions of various RNA species, etc. The extent of achievement relies significantly on the availability of modern DNA sequencers. Scientists in our lab at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) conduct research as well as perform regulatory functions. To meet the needs of DNA sequencing, we use ABI capillary DNA sequencers for sequencing analysis. The number of samples for DNA sequencing in general falls in the range between 60 and 400 per day. To prepare for large number of samples, sequencing reagents such as fluorescent dye (sold as BigDye kit, BDT) and Pop-7 polymer and capillary arrays need to be stocked to avoid supplies shortage. This request is to purchase BigDye kits, Pop-7 polymer, and 24- and 48-capillary arrays, buffers, and plates to be used in capillary DNA sequencing"

Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b). Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the Contracting Officer?s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: ? X? ?Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ?

When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet). When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format.

The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)).

For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2). Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8). Submission of electronic cost model.? The proposal submission shall include an electronic cost model with active formulas demonstrating the mathematical calculation of the proposed cost (in Excel).? The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.? If applicable, the electronic cost model shall link each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to the applicable CLINs.? The electronic cost model shall roll up to an annual and total program summary by cost element.? All information supporting each CLIN should be visible and verifiable in the electronic cost model.? The formulas included in the electronic cost model shall not be locked, and the model shall be editable by the Government.

The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; b. contract type; c. contract quantity; d. contract price; and e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)).

For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2).

Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8).

This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside this requirement among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. In the National Airspace System (NAS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) personnel rely on a variety of decision support tools and sources of information to perform their jobs. Controllers use their primary radar displays to monitor air traffic and operational information and make tactical decisions resulting in potential new clearances and information to the aircraft. However, operational personnel often need information in addition to that on their primary display (e.g., radar display, Traffic Situation Display (TSD), oceanic display) to assist in operational situations they encounter. The display of this information is provided through what is generally referred to as Information Display Systems (IDSs). E-IDS will provide an enterprise-level platform that implements, augments and/or replaces the multiple types of IDSs in, or in support of the NAS, including but not limited to En Route, Terminal, Traffic Flow, Oceanic and Offshore domains with common hardware and software. E-IDS will provide displays in over 500 FAA Air Traffic Control facilities and cover approximately 5000 controller positions. The FAA is currently working with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) to select a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) touchscreen display. The selected display will be installed on Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) compatible mounts allowing controllers to adjust and move the screen as needed. In many facilities, the display is located within a short distance from a controller?s head. As a result, the FAA must provide PSE that can be installed on the display to eliminate sharp edges that can lead to head injuries. The FAA is also seeking a solution that provides or incorporates grab handles for easy maneuvering of the display. The FAA will provide specifications for the selected display at a later date, but based on experience and projected needs, the agency intends to implement PSE for a 24-inch display. The PSE must meet the following anticipated minimum requirements: Withstand 24 hours a day, 365 (366 leap year) days a year operation, in an indoor environment. Operate without degradation at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Operate at a relative humidity between 30% - 80% at a temperature range of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Not emit ?out gas? fumes or contain any hazardous materials (e.g., mercury, acetone, asbestos, etc.) Not breakdown when cleaned or handled. Not breakdown due to display heat or exposure to direct sunlight. Be non-porous to prevent absorption of cleaning fluids or body oils. Eliminate sharp edges of the display. Absorb physical impact with users or other equipment. Maintain or increase the physical integrity and stability of the display. Not obstruct any screen area from any angle, either physically or visually. Provide access to the power button, but also obstruct light from the button. Provide access to all buttons (by appropriate personnel), but not expose buttons enough to allow Users to inadvertently turn off the display or change settings unintentionally. Not obstruct access to any of the display?s ports. Not increase the ?remove and replace? time for the display by more than 2 minutes. Not add more than 1 pound of weight to the display. Not add more than 1 inch to height and width of the display. Not obstruct the VESA mount in any way that prevents its use. Provide grab handles, or a sturdy ?grab area? on all 4 sides integrated into the PSE (e.g., recessed area) to accommodate maneuvering of the display. The FAA currently plans to release a Screening Information Request/Request for Proposal (SIR/RFP). At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do an unrestricted competition, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a suitable COTS product, or a vendor-designed and produced display PSE, meeting the minimum requirements above. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 339113. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: Submission of a capability statement that clearly demonstrates: (a) the administrative and technical skills and experience required to fully comply with the requirements of this effort; and (b) the ability to work successfully within the FAA infrastructure in complying with the safety, security, and operational requirements contained in FAA Orders and Advisory Circulars for performance of duties on airport property or within the confines of secured FAA facilities. Responses must be submitted on company letterhead, in a type font no less than 12 point and shall not exceed 10 pages in total length. Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.? Interested vendors must include the Unique Entity Identification Code (UEI) registered in SAM.gov and state business size. The FAA will not pay any costs vendors incur as a result of participation in this market survey. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.

Day meeting will be held on May 11, 2022 from 10:30 am to 5:00 pm EDT to introduce the SMART ePANTS program to potential proposers and to provide information on technical requirements and program objectives. To attend the event, participants must register (https://www.client-meeting.net/smart-epants-conference/) prior to Tuesday May 10, 2022 at 12 PM EDT. Same day registrations will not be accepted. Overview: The IARPA SMART ePANTS program aims to develop sensor systems that can record and store audio, video and location data. For maximum comfort and dexterity of the user, additional program objectives include sensor integration into clothing, where the garment maintains similar stretchability, bendability, surface roughness and washability attributes to a comparable garment containing no sensor. SMART ePANTS sensor systems must also be safely worn against the skin, be reusable, and be capable of exporting the data they gather to an external data storage device (such as a computer hard drive). Sensor systems will be entirely incorporated into garment components, especially fibers, yarn and fabric, but may include (to a limited extent) expected commercial (i.e., currently available for sale) garment accessories such as buttons, grommets, zippers, piping or collar stays. *****PLEASE REVIEW ATTACHED 'SMART ePANTS Proposers Day Announcement' DOCUMENT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS*****"

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices. Submitted documents shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. Proposal Contents: COVER LETTER - Shall not exceed 2 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: AOI for which proposal is submitted (number and title) Company name, physical address, mailing address, and website URL Note: CSO is a streamlined acquisition process -- The Government intends to evaluate proposals on a rolling basis up until 9 Sep 2022, and as applicable, execute awards NLT 48 hours after receipt of proposals.

Proposal Submission This is an ?Open CSO,? meaning the CSO will accept proposals until 9 Sep 2022, or until an award has been made.? Proposals are reviewed, at a minimum, every 60 days, beginning 1 Jan 2022.? The first cutoff date for proposals to be eligible for the February review is 6 Feb 2022.? The Open CSO will be amended to provide future cutoff dates. The final deadline for receipt of proposals in response to this Open CSO is NLT 8:00am Eastern Daylight Time, 9 Sep 2022. Offerors may submit proposal amendments any time prior to the proposal deadline specified herein, however 23 CONS will ONLY review the final amended proposal that is submitted. Please ensure that your e-mail address listed in your proposal is current and accurate. 23 CONS is not responsible for ensuring notifications are received by firms changing mailing address/e-mail address/company points of contact after proposal submission without proper notification to 23 CONS. Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the solicitation or amendments. A proposal is acceptable if it conforms to all material requirements of the CSO, otherwise it is unacceptable and may be ineligible for award. **Note: Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to this solicitation are reviewed carefully prior to submitting a proposal. The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Further funding discussions will be contained the AOI. Notifications of Award and Protests Unsuccessful offerors shall receive notification of award and small business status of awardees.? Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ? Defense Commercial Solutions Opening Pilot Program, DARS Tracking No. 2018-O0016?

Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this rapid separation of Ta-185 radioisotopes technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Short-lived radioisotopes are important for any application aiming to limit a radiological dose. Most radiopharmaceuticals have half-lives of several days as the time required between production, separation, drug incorporation, and delivery to the patient can take several days to a week. INL?s technology would accelerate this process by producing the isotopes on-demand at the point of use. By introducing a fast separation method, the total isotope preparation time would be reduced drastically to only ~1-2 hours. Description:?? ?INL?s technology utilizes nuclear instrumentation and a modular rapid chemical separation system developed at INL to produce ultra-short-lived radionuclides such as Ta-185, in-house and on-demand. The key features of the method are production of Ta-185 via irradiation of W-186 with a linear accelerator, an optimized irradiation method for maximum Ta-185 production and rapid chemical separation technique utilizing a stream-lined rapid chromatographic isotope separation system (S-RCISS) to quickly separate and isolate Ta-185. Benefits:??? ?????? Novel separation system drastically surpassing rapidity of current systems. The rapid separation allows on-site and on-demand production of radioisotopes. ? Applications:?? Radioisotope applications. Opens up a new market for ultra-short-lived radioisotope applications. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is an early-stage concept and needs further testing. IP Status: ??????? Provisional Patent Application No. 63/203,858, ?Methods for Producing Radionuclides Using Accelerator Bremsstrahlung Irradiation and Rapid Chromatographic Isotope Separation,? BEA Docket No. 1252 Additional Information INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.??? Synopsis/Solicitation N0017822Q6768 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).? The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation as indicated in the attached SF18.? The SF18 form is being utilized to generate the applicable clauses from the Standard Procurement System.? This requirement is not eligible for small business set-aside. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to procure on a Brand Name or Equal basis for the purchase of Kaydon?s manufactured ball spacers to minimize rotational friction; thin dense chrome plating. Kaydon?s Thin Dense Chrome plating has been characterized for both bearings. Friction characterization data for alternate vendor?s Thin Dense Chrome plating is not currently available for 564772B1 equivalent bearings and using an alternate vendor?s coating would incur risk of degradation to system performance. The equipment must be identical (form, fit, and function) with the equipment already secured. The Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system will be installed on AEGIS ships, meeting the form, fit, and function requirements of the AEGIS system along with the operating system on which the Aegis system executes. The ceramic ball bearings must be compatible in form, fit, and function with each other as well as the existing hardware within the anticipated operating environments for the systems. Utilization of these commercial hardware components has reduced cost and shortened the development schedule for the program by minimizing the amount of engineering to the greatest extent possible. While other vendors sell similar products to Kaydon Bearings that may meet form and fit requirements, they are unable to fulfill function requirements. Procuring bearings thru another vendor other than Kaydon would incur risk to the overall bearing performance, which will adversely affect system level performance. Kaydon bearings are previously tested and currently in fielded systems. The Kaydon Bearings were previously purchased under contract number N0017819P6753 and N0017821P6626. Utilizing an alternate bearings would result in an unanticipated and unbudgeted duplication of costs and an estimated twelve (12) months to redesign, test, develop and field new equipment and processes. In addition, there would be cost impact and a schedule slip to the upcoming ship installation dates. As this has been acknowledged as a Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) project by the Chief, Naval Operations, a slip in the installation dates will be unacceptable. Please include shipping/freight cost to Dahlgren, VA 22448-5114. Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) will be utilized for award in accordance with FAR Part 13.? The order shall be firm fixed price.?? All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.? The completion and submission to the Government of an offer shall indicate the Offeror?s unconditional agreement to the terms and conditions in this solicitation. Offers may be rejected if an exception to the terms or conditions set forth in this solicitation is taken. At time of proposal submission please submit any historical data as well as published pricing.? Quotes will only be accepted from authorized re-sellers who have provided a Letter of Authorization.? Award will be made based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).?
