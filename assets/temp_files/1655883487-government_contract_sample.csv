IMOC III Description: It is anticipated that the IMOC III will be a Single-Award, 100% Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to cost-plus-fixed-fee and/or firm-fixed-price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the Draft IMOC III Statement of Work is attached to this posting. A summary of content for the proposed IMOC III contract includes, but is not limited to, the following: To provide support and products for spaceflight operations capability development and execution for the JSC FOD and the International Space Station Program (ISSP): Avionics and Software Office (OD). This includes support to mission preparation (Plan), crew, flight controller, instructor, and analyst training (Train), and real-time mission execution (Fly) activities related to exploration operations and the International Space Station operations. Operations capability development support is required from the contractor as NASA defines operations requirements associated with the emerging options for the exploration initiatives and potential new programs, including, but not limited the Artemis Program (Orion Spacecraft, the Space Launch System Program, Exploration Ground Systems, Gateway, Lunar Landers and Excursion Vehicles), Commercial Crew and Cargo, Commercial Low Earth Orbit, and advanced technology and research. IMOC III requirements may include, but are not limited to, services such as: Contract Management and Administration Operations Support for Vehicle / System / Program Design and Development Mission Preparation (Plan) including Technical Integration, Product Development, Mission Analysis, and Mission and Training Systems Support Mission Training (Train) Development, Planning, Documentation, and Execution Mission Execution (Fly) including Real-Time Mission Support and Postflight Analysis Astronaut Office and CAPCOM Support Avionics and Software Integration, Coordination, And Support Activities The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: KBR Wyle Services, LLC Contract Number: NNJ14RA01B Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $1.3 billion Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2023 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the draft IMOC III SOW. Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time).

If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on April 25, 2022. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice/RFI must be emailed to jsc-imoc3@mail.nasa.gov . An Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

IMOC III requirements may include, but are not limited to, services such as: Contract Management and Administration Operations Support for Vehicle / System / Program Design and Development Mission Preparation (Plan) including Technical Integration, Product Development, Mission Analysis, and Mission and Training Systems Support Mission Training (Train) Development, Planning, Documentation, and Execution Mission Execution (Fly) including Real-Time Mission Support and Postflight Analysis Astronaut Office and CAPCOM Support Avionics and Software Integration, Coordination, And Support Activities The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: KBR Wyle Services, LLC Contract Number: NNJ14RA01B Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $1.3 billion Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2023 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the draft IMOC III SOW. Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: ?Name and address of firm Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) Size of business Average annual revenue for past three years Number of employees Whether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a Number of years in business Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners If you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor? A list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on April 25, 2022. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice/RFI must be emailed to jsc-imoc3@mail.nasa.gov . An Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

The project includes constructing three (3) gated water control structures along the L-67A levee, degradation of 15 existing spoil piles along L-67A canal, and plugging and partial backfill of an existing Agricultural Ditch. The project is anticipated for a potential fiscal year (FY) 2023 award. There is no solicitation at this time. ?This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The Jacksonville Districts anticipates the issuance of a Invitation for Bid (IFB). No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought or any follow-up information requested. Project Description: The work will be performed in a rural area of Dade County, Florida. The entrance to the project site is on the north side of US-41 (Tamiami Trial) and approximately 12 miles west of the intersection with US-27. The Scope of Work for this project includes the following three (3) items, (A) Install the proposed L-67A levee structures; S-631, S-632, and S-633 detailed as new gated flood control culverts, with 5.5-ft. x 5.5-ft. manual vertical slide gates, two (2) sets of stop logs, each with total design capacity of 500 cubic feet per second (cfs) to convey water from WCA 3A to WCA 3B; (B) Degrade 15 existing spoil piles located along the west side of the L-67A canal and move the material onto the project construction site; and (C) Construct earthen plugs within the existing east-west agricultural ditch, degrade existing spoil piles along the north side of the ditch, and partially backfill portions of the ditch. Specific Project Challenges: The work will be performed in a rural area of Dade County, Florida with limited access along a narrow existing levee embankment. The work is along the existing L-67A levee and within the surrounding Everglades Swamp lands. The lands outside the footprint of the levee are prone to flooding at all times of the year and the ground conditions are very soft and wet during all times of the year. Some of the work is located in or along existing canals which will require barges for access. The work will also require processing of on-site materials to produce embankment fill materials meeting the project specifications. It is anticipated that the work within and along the agricultural ditch will require the use of amphibious equipment and the use of hydraulic pump operations to move materials for the proposed ditch plugs. The contractor must be able to provide as-builts of the finished work acceptable to the Government. The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires installations to be energy resilient and microgrids are being pursued to meet those energy resiliency goals. Energy resilience, as defined by DoD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, is defined as ?the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that impact mission assurance on military installations.? As defined by the Microgrid Exchange Group (MEG), ?A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.? A Microgrid, at a minimum, is a system of interconnected loads (such as, but not limited to, buildings or structures) and distributed energy resources (such as, but not limited to, generators, photovoltaics, wind farms, energy storage) which are physically separated and located throughout a complex or military installation which are to operate and function together as one entity to provide energy to mission essential loads when needed. The Microgrid is to provide power in a similar fashion to a utility providers electrical distribution system. It must also provide demand response and be able to disconnect from the utility provider?s electrical distribution system as needed to operate in an island mode. The Microgrid is to control the distributed energy resources, so they function together as a whole even though they are physically separated and originally intended to provide power to a single load for example. The Microgrid can provide power to an entire complex or installation, or to selected mission essential loads within the complex or installation. An electrical system with various energy resources which provides power to a single load is not considered a Microgrid. The work under this contract will primarily be in support of Military Installations, with occasional support of Civil Works, and the Work for Others Programs. Work will be within the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii. Primary work under this contract will involve but not be limited to: inspection and condition assessment surveys of existing sites, verification of existing reference materials, verification of existing conditions, data collection of energy usage, assets, and infrastructure, consulting and coordinating with stakeholders to define priority missions and loads, risk identification and assessment, concept development, engineering and design, Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), cost estimating and life cycle cost analysis, system modeling and studies, technical specification preparation, testing, participation in the commissioning of, and report writing, all related to the design of microgrids. Secondary work will involve, but not be limited to, the design, construction, renovation and/or alteration to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities and repair and maintenance to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities. Types of related work including but not limited to highway, other paved surfaces, utility systems, site work, and Energy Resiliency Conservation and Improvement Projects (ERCIP) may be a part of both the primary and secondary work.

This will allow for an expedited procurement process for the customer and the acquisition force. Background The Abiomed Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist catheter is a disposable component of an Impella driver/controller system currently utilized at the VA Healthcare System. This Item is required/specific for high risk Cardiac/Coronary interventions. These are used in critically ill patients during acute coronary intervention to support the ventricular function of the heart and helping reduce cardiogenic shock. Item Specifications: The Catheter is a sterile tubular device with a built in electrically powered axial flow pump. The distal end designed to provide circulatory assistance to the heart by pumping blood during heart failure. It is inserted through the lumen of the aorta and into the left ventricle, surgically or percutaneously via an artery. Then connected to an external control unit that moves blood from the left ventricle to the aorta across the aortic valve. The Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist heart pump delivers full cardiac support, allowing the heart to rest and enabling the heart to achieve its natural pumping function without additional support. The heart pump is designed for long-duration support, enabling patient mobility, and optimizing recovery by using real-time intelligence. Used during cardiogenic shock, the Impella 5.5 will support the heart s pumping function, providing blood and oxygen to vital organs. This Catheter is typically used emergently post-acute myocardial infarction, electively for high-risk cardiac catheterizations for open chest surgery. This component is used in conjunction with the Impella device and has a clear indication for Cardiogenic Shock and is used as an assist device in such cases to stabilize the patient for transfer to a critical care facility. This catheter must be compatible with the Abiomed Automated Impella Controller. The Automated Impella Controller is the primary user control interface for the Impella platform featuring a 10-inch high-resolution display. It controls the Impella catheter performance, monitors for alarms, and displays real-time hemodynamic and catheter position information.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS We anticipate release of a solicitation for a multiple-award indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (MAIDIQ) contract vehicle for design-build or design-bid-build Projects that may include, but are not limited to, renovation and new construction, sustainment, restoration and modernization of storm water facilities and attendant infrastructures, fuel line and associated infrastructure (i.e. a fillstand and containment area) installation, related or similar bio-remediation work, parking lot work and paving, curb, and gutter on the Pentagon Reservation. Some work may involve above and/or underground utilities. A draft IDIQ Statement of Work is attached. Many of the projects anticipated under this MAIDIQ are related to the reducing pollutant load for Pentagon Reservation storm water discharges. The Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) was established in 2019 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a limit on the amount of pollutants that can enter the Bay. The Commonwealth of Virginia and the other states within the Chesapeake Bay watershed have specific load reductions that they must meet as part of this ?pollution diet? for the Bay.? Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in Virginia, including the Pentagon, are required to comply with the state-mandated pollutant load reductions as outlined in their Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) MS4 permits issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VADEQ). Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is the operator of the Pentagon?s MS4 and is responsible for compliance with the Virginia MS4 permit. The MS4 permit requires permittees to comply with the Chesapeake Bay TMDL by reducing pollutant loads for sediment (total suspended solids, or TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in storm water discharges. We anticipate a 100% set-aside of this requirement for Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns under NAICS 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction. SBA certification as a WOSB concern is required to submit an offer. We anticipate all responsible SBA Certified Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns under NAICS 237310 otherwise eligible to submit and receive an award, with an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), an established place of business in Virginia, Maryland, or the District of Columbia, at least $15 million per contract bonding capacity, and at least a $30 million aggregate bonding capacity may submit a proposal for consideration. Our geographic location requirement is separate and apart from any SBA requirement related to a bona fide place of business. We anticipate pass/fail gateway criteria, experience, and past performance evaluation factors.? There will be no seed project or price volume required for the MAIDIQ competition. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2305(a)(3) and FAR 15.303 (c)(1)(ii), the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors.? A qualifying offeror is an offeror determined to be a responsible source, submits a technically acceptable proposal which conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, and the Contracting Officer has no reason to believe would be likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.? Price will become an evaluation factor for award at the task order level.? Individual Task Orders are contemplated on a firm-fixed price basis. Each IDIQ contract will include up to a 10 year ordering period, comprised of a 3-year base period, three 2-year options, and a final 1-year option. We anticipate a ceiling value of approximately $135 million shared among all IDIQ contract award receipients. The actual ceiling value per IDIQ award may vary depending on the number of awards made. The minimum guarantee for each IDIQ contract is anticipated as $10,000.00.? We anticipate many fair opportunity task orders valued between $500,000.00 and $15,000,000.00 during the ordering period.? Some example projects for anticipated fair opportunity competition under this MAIDIQ contract vehicle over the next several years, subject to availability of funds, include the following: Bio-retention Facilities and Tree Boxes to treat the surface runoff to maximize the pollutant load reduction and safely redirect the discharge downstream.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires installations to be energy resilient and microgrids are being pursued to meet those energy resiliency goals. Energy resilience, as defined by DoD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, is defined as ?the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that impact mission assurance on military installations.? As defined by the Microgrid Exchange Group (MEG), ?A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.? A Microgrid, at a minimum, is a system of interconnected loads (such as, but not limited to, buildings or structures) and distributed energy resources (such as, but not limited to, generators, photovoltaics, wind farms, energy storage) which are physically separated and located throughout a complex or military installation which are to operate and function together as one entity to provide energy to mission essential loads when needed. The Microgrid is to provide power in a similar fashion to a utility providers electrical distribution system. It must also provide demand response and be able to disconnect from the utility provider?s electrical distribution system as needed to operate in an island mode. The Microgrid is to control the distributed energy resources, so they function together as a whole even though they are physically separated and originally intended to provide power to a single load for example. The Microgrid can provide power to an entire complex or installation, or to selected mission essential loads within the complex or installation. An electrical system with various energy resources which provides power to a single load is not considered a Microgrid. The work under this contract will primarily be in support of Military Installations, with occasional support of Civil Works, and the Work for Others Programs. Work will be within the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii. Primary work under this contract will involve but not be limited to: inspection and condition assessment surveys of existing sites, verification of existing reference materials, verification of existing conditions, data collection of energy usage, assets, and infrastructure, consulting and coordinating with stakeholders to define priority missions and loads, risk identification and assessment, concept development, engineering and design, Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), cost estimating and life cycle cost analysis, system modeling and studies, technical specification preparation, testing, participation in the commissioning of, and report writing, all related to the design of microgrids. Secondary work will involve, but not be limited to, the design, construction, renovation and/or alteration to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities and repair and maintenance to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities. Types of related work including but not limited to highway, other paved surfaces, utility systems, site work, and Energy Resiliency Conservation and Improvement Projects (ERCIP) may be a part of both the primary and secondary work. Both primary and secondary work shall include design and construction support to include the following professional disciplines: architects, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and geotechnical engineers, interior designers, landscape architects, and specification writers. LEED Accredited Professional(s) are required in addition to Licensed Professional Engineers and Registered Architects. The following Tertiary work and Related work will only be performed as needed to complete the work related to Microgrids and ERCIP efforts. Tertiary work will include, but not be limited to, preparation of concept, preliminary, and detailed designs for the removal, remediation, abatement and restoration of environmental hazards including soil and groundwater, lead paint, asbestos, PCB's, and other contaminated wastes. Professional qualifications for the third level of work shall include but not be limited to: environmental engineers/environmental scientists, certified industrial hygienists, geologists, and hydrologists/hydraulic engineers. Related work will include historical preservation, economic and life cycle cost analysis, planning, site investigations, design analysis, claims analysis, schedule preparation, surveying, studies, reports, and expert witness efforts. In addition to professional disciplines previously listed, surveyors, specification writers, cost estimators, and CADD/BIM (Building Information Modeling) technicians shall be included for all levels of work as required. SELECTION CRITERIA:? Selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance.?

The plan should describe the AE?s proposed work management approach for executing the work to be performed under this contract including team composition, roles and responsibilities of key team members and each subcontracted firm and its approach for ensuring high quality work products performed by the firm and their subcontractors.? The plan shall include information on quality control processes and procedures, cost and schedule control, coordination of in-house disciplines and consultants, and relevant experience working with each of the subcontractors on similar projects.? Section C, Section D, Section G and Section H of the SF 330 will be used to evaluate this criterion.? In reviewing the above project management and teaming information, the evaluation board will consider how the firms, including joint ventures (JV) and Offerors utilizing of affiliates, subsidiaries, parent, LLC, LTD member companies, propose to execute the scopes of work (Section 2 Project Information).? Organization of the firm?s team will be evaluated in accordance with Section 4 Submission Requirements (e.g., JV, Mentor-Prot?g?, etc.). d. Past Performance. ?The firm shall possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, and ability to manage subcontractors.? Assessment against this criterion will be determined primarily by evaluating ratings performed in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), the Government-wide evaluation reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts, or via those provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs).? In reviewing past performance information, the evaluation board will consider the relevancy of the past performed work in addition to how well the firm performed.? Positive references from customers and other verifiable information as to exemplary performance may also be considered as provided in Section H of the SF330.? With their SF330, the firm shall provide the CPARS report or PPQ for each of the projects identified in Section F of the SF330.?

NOTE: The most recent CPARS report is to be provided for any federal contract unless a specific explanation is provided as to unavailability of a CPARS rating. Do not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS is available.? If a project is not a federal project or a CPARS report is not available, the firm shall complete Part I of the PPQ, send it to the customers, request that they complete Part II of the PPQ and return to the firm, and submit it with the SF330 submission.? No sealed envelope is required.? A blank PPQ can be found attached to this synopsis (Attachment B). The evaluation board may seek and consider past performance information from other sources but is not required to do so if none is available from CPARS or if no PPQ is provided.? Other sources of information the evaluation board may consider include interviews with organizations and Government personnel familiar with the firm?s performance.? If little to no relevant past performance data (CPARS reports, PPQs, or information in Section H) is available, the firm may be given a neutral evaluation regarding past performance.? CPARS reports or PPQs shall be placed at the end of Part I of the SF330 (they will not be counted towards the page count). e. Capacity. ?The firm must demonstrate the capacity for successfully executing multiple task orders concurrently while maintaining quality and schedule.? A firm shall be evaluated on the available capacity of key personnel from the prime firm and its teaming consultants primarily through a review of each firm?s Part II submission and any information provided in SF330 Section H as to their methods for managing workload.? The prime contractor needs to demonstrate that they have the core competencies to perform work required under the contract on their own merit.? In order to meet or exceed the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, ""Limitations on Subcontracting (Sept 2021)"", the prime contractor along with ?similarly situated? subcontractors must have the capacity to perform at least 51% of the work over the life of the contract.? ?Similarly situated? subcontractor means a first-tier subcontractor, including an independent contractor that has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the award and that is considered small for the specified NAICS code (example - if prime is a WOSB, then subcontractors that are WOSB would count towards the goal).? The firm should address how it will meet these requirements based upon the assumption that the items listed under ?Specialized Experience and Technical Competence? above constitute the preponderance of the work to be performed under this contract. f. Knowledge of Locality. ?Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve federal installations throughout CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii. The board will evaluate a firm's knowledge and experience with working on military installations and other federal complexes across the country. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, F, and H of the SF 330.? g. ?Extent of Participation of Small Businesses (SB) concerns.? Firms shall identify their small business team members and indicate their commitment to utilize SBs to include Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB).? Extent of use will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the small business concern is a prime contractor, sub-contractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation the greater the consideration. ? h. Volume of DoD Contract Awards.? Firms shall indicate in Section H of the SF330 the volume of DoD AE contracts awarded to the prime (or JV) in the last 12 months. This information will be verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.

The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees. Purchase of one (1) brand name or equal MSD ELISA Instrument (reader), MESO QuickPlex SQ 12 for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies (OTAT), Division of Plasma Protein Therapeutics (DPPT), Hemostasis Branch (HB). Part of this market research effort is to determine that only this name brand instrument can meet CBER?s requirement. Alternative solutions will be considered insofar as any such alternate system and/or system components meet the minimum brand name or equal technical requirements. Background The CBER/OTAT/DPPT/HB regulates Plasma Protein Therapeutics intended to treat patients with abnormal hemostasis in particular, deficiencies in blood coagulation, and performs research in this area. The laboratory studies biochemistry of blood coagulation involving factor VIII (FVIII) which deficiency results in life-threating bleeding known as Hemophilia A. In particular, the study of (i) structure and functions of FVIII related to plasma clearance of FVIII that is relevant to FDA review and generation of longer-acting FVIII products, and product-related impurity in therapeutic FVIII products relevant to increasing purity of FVIII products. Altogether, these directions are related to generation of more efficient and safer FVIII products to improve treatment of Hemophilia A. Purchase of MSD ELISA Instrument or equal will allow detection and quantitation of FVIII and its experimental variants with extremely high sensitivity and selectivity (specificity) in a wide dynamic range in various complex matrixes, containing numerous interfering compounds, such as cell culture media and both human and model animals (mice etc.) plasma, as the system uses a unique proprietary electrochemiluminescence protein detection. The MSD ELISA Instrument or equal required for the project is needed to measure very low concentrations of FVIII in both cell culture upon protein expression and animal plasma in FVIII pharmacokinetics studies, as no other methodology, including common types of ELISA applications, can measure protein content at such conditions with required sensitivity. Also, the methodology allows measuring concentrations of other proteins related to different research projects, and study aims. Minimum Performance Requirements Sensitivity: At least 10-100 pg of protein antigen/mL in particular assays Specificity: The assay must be based on Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle Dynamic Range: Wide linearity such as that in the range of 104-105 concentration units Plate read time (based on ECL principle): Not more than 2 min Size: Compact, not more than 14 x 25 x 22 (in).

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) / (AFRC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for Flight opportunities Program Flight and Payload Integration Services IV. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. Information received in response to this sources sought notice will be used for market research only and shall not be viewed as NASA?s intent to solicit proposals. If NASA decides a requirement exists and there is a need to solicit for this requirement, NASA will solicit the requirement using a method of solicitation defined within the FAR and NASA FAR Supplement, using NAICS Code and Size Standard 481219 and $16.5M revenue, respectively. DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE: Potential sources must be primarily a United States domestic entity. Potential sources must demonstrate their capability of providing Flight and Payload Integration Services and in some instances, human accommodations. Typical platforms will include (but are not limited to) high-altitude balloons, suborbital rockets, sounding rockets, rocket powered landing vehicles and vertical flight testbeds, which must be capable of meeting one or more of the required flight profiles. Vehicles for flight services shall be currently operational, in a flight test status as a minimum, and conclusively demonstrated to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements as defined in the flight profiles. Legacy vehicles not currently in operational status will not be considered as qualifying for the purposes of meeting the flight profile requirements. Vehicles must be capable of accommodating a minimum payload mass of 5Kg and minimum payload volume equivalent to a 5U cubesat (5L or 5,000cc). The required flight profiles shall consist of the following, defined from the payload perspective: Profile 1 (P1): Reduced gravity with space environment Payload is typically an experiment requiring two (2) or more minutes of continuous microgravity and/or exposure to the space environment. Requirement is to ascend to a minimum of 80km above mean sea level (MSL), desired ? 100km MSL, and expose the payload to a total gravitational vector of less than +/- 0.005g (RMS) under stable gravitational conditions in all axes for at least two (2) minutes. Some payloads may also require the simultaneous exposure of the payload to near-vacuum and low temperature. This is typically accomplished by use of a sounding rocket or spacecraft. Vehicles that can achieve the required altitude and reduced gravity but cannot expose the payload to the outside environment may also be qualified for this profile. Profile 2 (P2): Exposure to high altitude and long-duration flight Under this profile, platforms shall offer the payload with external views, including a view of the earth below as well as access to the environment for sensing. Payload types will vary, including remote sensing packages or other systems being qualified for use on satellites or other spacecraft. These can be tested by use of an untethered balloon with parachute descent that could allow, for example, for testing experimental parachutes or similar atmospheric descent systems. Other platforms could include untethered balloons or untethered airships with guided trajectory capabilities and controlled landings. The aforementioned platforms may have additional capabilities such as altitude loitering or geolocation station keeping. In all cases, landing characteristics should be sufficient to recover the payload by means of a soft landing or a parachute recovery, for example. For consideration under this profile, a QV shall meet the requirements listed below: ? ? ? ? ? Exposure to high altitude:? ? ? ? ? ? Payload is typically an experiment requiring exposure to the near-space environment at a minimum of 30km MSL with a flight time of 1 hour or greater along a pre-planned guided flight trajectory, followed by a descent to 0 AGL. ? ? ? ? ? Exposure to altitude and long-duration flight: ? ? ? ? ? Payload is typically an experiment requiring exposure to an altitude of at least 18 km MSL and have a float time of 7 days or greater along a pre-planned flight trajectory, followed by a descent to 0 AGL. Profile 3 (P3): Space environment with free-fall descent Payload typically involves testing of systems and components such as thermal protection or decelerators for objects reentering a planetary atmosphere. Requirement is to attain a minimum of 80km MSL, typically ? 100km MSL, followed by a rapid free-fall descent of the payload to 0 km AGL. This is typically accomplished by use of a sounding rocket or spacecraft with the payload ejected at apogee. Profile 4 (P4): Controlled descent with controlled vertical landing Payload is typically an experiment to test concepts for planetary landers. Requirement is to descend from a minimum of 250m above ground level (AGL) to 0m AGL, under controlled rocket-powered flight and conduct a controlled vertical landing. Some payloads may require controlled horizontal translation of up to 1 km. Some applications may require allowing the payload to actively control portions of the flight profile. This is typically accomplished by use of a spacecraft or a vertical flight testbed. Profile 5 (P5): Controlled high altitude ascent and descent Requirement is to ascend to a minimum of 30km MSL along a pre-planned trajectory, spend 1 or more minutes above 30km MSL, and then descend back to 0 AGL along a controlled trajectory. Payload is typically a remote sensing system for planetary entry, high-altitude atmospheric measurements, or similar applications. Payloads may require access to the external environment to make observations or obtain measurements. It would be desirable to have the capability of accepting control inputs from the payload. It would also be desirable to provide the payload a view of the earth below. Landing should be sufficient to recover the payload intact, which may entail either a soft landing or a parachute recovery. In some cases, platforms may have different ascent and descent locations as part of a single flight. This is typically accomplished by use of a spacecraft or first (primary) stage of a multi-stage rocket-powered vehicle. Some payloads may be required to achieve short durations of reduced gravity under this flight profile.

How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website.

IMOC III requirements may include, but are not limited to, services such as: Contract Management and Administration Operations Support for Vehicle / System / Program Design and Development Mission Preparation (Plan) including Technical Integration, Product Development, Mission Analysis, and Mission and Training Systems Support Mission Training (Train) Development, Planning, Documentation, and Execution Mission Execution (Fly) including Real-Time Mission Support and Postflight Analysis Astronaut Office and CAPCOM Support Avionics and Software Integration, Coordination, And Support Activities The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: KBR Wyle Services, LLC Contract Number: NNJ14RA01B Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $1.3 billion Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2023 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the draft IMOC III SOW. Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: ?Name and address of firm Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) Size of business Average annual revenue for past three years Number of employees Whether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a Number of years in business Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners If you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor? A list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

This code currently defines the Small Business size standard as $16.5M of gross annual revenues.? The Small Business Administration is proposing to update this size standard definition in 2022 but has not yet been made.? Determination of which pool a firm is to be evaluated in (Large or Small Business) will be made based on the size standard in effect as of a selection decision by Baltimore District.? An amendment notifying firms of any change in the NAICS 541330 size standard will be issued for this synopsis should that determination be made during the solicitation period.? Firms should structure their SF330 submission accordingly. Awards are anticipated by August 2022. A firm can submit a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontractor to a Large Business on the unrestricted award. However, the Agency's intent is that a particular offeror may only receive one (1) award as a prime contractor under this IDIQ. For example, if the same firm submits as a Prime on both the Small Business reserve and the unrestricted award, the firm can only obtain one (1) award of an IDIQ, not two (2).??Secondly, while there is no proscription against a firm submitting a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontracting on the unrestricted award. We do note that being both a prime and subcontractor on an IDIQ can sometimes raise risks in the technical evaluation, and potential questions regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest, if both entities decide to propose on the same task order. For example, if a firm is a key subcontractor for five different proposals, it could raise questions in regards to whether the firm had the total resources to support each procurement, which could impact the technical evaluation of the offerors.? If selected for negotiation, large businesses will be required to submit subcontracting plans that address small business utilization and provide maximum practicable opportunities to Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) , Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone), Small Disadvantaged, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Black College University (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) and Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB). If USACE finds a prospective firm to be non-compliant with their subcontracting plans on previous contracts, the firm may not be eligible for award under this synopsis. Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans as part of their response. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal but will be required with the price proposal of the large firms selected. To be eligible for a contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov. Inherently governmental functions will not be performed by firms per FAR Part 7.5. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Baltimore District; however, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to approve capacity requests from other Districts outside of the Baltimore Districts mission boundaries to support USACE missions, when advantageous to the Government. In accordance with FAR section 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, a performance evaluation will be prepared at least annually and at the time the task order is completed for all task orders above $35,000. A performance evaluation may be prepared for task orders below $35,000. interim performance evaluations may be prepared for a task order at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for A-E services. (1) PROJECT INFORMATION.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS We anticipate release of a solicitation for a multiple-award indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (MAIDIQ) contract vehicle for design-build or design-bid-build Projects that may include, but are not limited to, renovation and new construction, sustainment, restoration and modernization of storm water facilities and attendant infrastructures, fuel line and associated infrastructure (i.e. a fillstand and containment area) installation, related or similar bio-remediation work, parking lot work and paving, curb, and gutter on the Pentagon Reservation. Some work may involve above and/or underground utilities. A draft IDIQ Statement of Work is attached. Many of the projects anticipated under this MAIDIQ are related to the reducing pollutant load for Pentagon Reservation storm water discharges. The Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) was established in 2019 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a limit on the amount of pollutants that can enter the Bay. The Commonwealth of Virginia and the other states within the Chesapeake Bay watershed have specific load reductions that they must meet as part of this ?pollution diet? for the Bay.? Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in Virginia, including the Pentagon, are required to comply with the state-mandated pollutant load reductions as outlined in their Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) MS4 permits issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VADEQ). Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is the operator of the Pentagon?s MS4 and is responsible for compliance with the Virginia MS4 permit. The MS4 permit requires permittees to comply with the Chesapeake Bay TMDL by reducing pollutant loads for sediment (total suspended solids, or TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in storm water discharges. We anticipate a 100% set-aside of this requirement for Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns under NAICS 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction. SBA certification as a WOSB concern is required to submit an offer. We anticipate all responsible SBA Certified Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) concerns under NAICS 237310 otherwise eligible to submit and receive an award, with an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), an established place of business in Virginia, Maryland, or the District of Columbia, at least $15 million per contract bonding capacity, and at least a $30 million aggregate bonding capacity may submit a proposal for consideration. Our geographic location requirement is separate and apart from any SBA requirement related to a bona fide place of business. We anticipate pass/fail gateway criteria, experience, and past performance evaluation factors.? There will be no seed project or price volume required for the MAIDIQ competition. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2305(a)(3) and FAR 15.303 (c)(1)(ii), the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors.? A qualifying offeror is an offeror determined to be a responsible source, submits a technically acceptable proposal which conforms to the requirements of the solicitation, and the Contracting Officer has no reason to believe would be likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.? Price will become an evaluation factor for award at the task order level.? Individual Task Orders are contemplated on a firm-fixed price basis. Each IDIQ contract will include up to a 10 year ordering period, comprised of a 3-year base period, three 2-year options, and a final 1-year option. We anticipate a ceiling value of approximately $135 million shared among all IDIQ contract award receipients. The actual ceiling value per IDIQ award may vary depending on the number of awards made. The minimum guarantee for each IDIQ contract is anticipated as $10,000.00.? We anticipate many fair opportunity task orders valued between $500,000.00 and $15,000,000.00 during the ordering period.?

Awards will be made under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services. This code currently defines the Small Business size standard as $16.5M of gross annual revenues.? The Small Business Administration is proposing to update this size standard definition in 2022 but has not yet been made.? Determination of which pool a firm is to be evaluated in (Large or Small Business) will be made based on the size standard in effect as of a selection decision by Baltimore District.? An amendment notifying firms of any change in the NAICS 541330 size standard will be issued for this synopsis should that determination be made during the solicitation period.? Firms should structure their SF330 submission accordingly. Awards are anticipated by August 2022. A firm can submit a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontractor to a Large Business on the unrestricted award. However, the Agency's intent is that a particular offeror may only receive one (1) award as a prime contractor under this IDIQ. For example, if the same firm submits as a Prime on both the Small Business reserve and the unrestricted award, the firm can only obtain one (1) award of an IDIQ, not two (2).??Secondly, while there is no proscription against a firm submitting a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontracting on the unrestricted award. We do note that being both a prime and subcontractor on an IDIQ can sometimes raise risks in the technical evaluation, and potential questions regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest, if both entities decide to propose on the same task order. For example, if a firm is a key subcontractor for five different proposals, it could raise questions in regards to whether the firm had the total resources to support each procurement, which could impact the technical evaluation of the offerors.? If selected for negotiation, large businesses will be required to submit subcontracting plans that address small business utilization and provide maximum practicable opportunities to Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) , Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone), Small Disadvantaged, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Black College University (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) and Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB). If USACE finds a prospective firm to be non-compliant with their subcontracting plans on previous contracts, the firm may not be eligible for award under this synopsis. Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans as part of their response. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal but will be required with the price proposal of the large firms selected. To be eligible for a contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov. Inherently governmental functions will not be performed by firms per FAR Part 7.5. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Baltimore District; however, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to approve capacity requests from other Districts outside of the Baltimore Districts mission boundaries to support USACE missions, when advantageous to the Government. In accordance with FAR section 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, a performance evaluation will be prepared at least annually and at the time the task order is completed for all task orders above $35,000. A performance evaluation may be prepared for task orders below $35,000. interim performance evaluations may be prepared for a task order at any time.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District (NAB) plans to award a target of eight (8) separate Architect/Engineer (A/E) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to comprise one (1) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A/E services to support Hazardous, Toxic, Radioactive Waste (HTRW) and Military Munitions (MM) projects. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and agency supplements. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The A/E Services will support various, nationwide environmental support projects. The contracts will be used for projects within USACE's NAD mission AOR, with incidental utilization in the contiguous United States and in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, excluding Europe, in support of other USACE regions. The approximately eight (8) IDIQs will be negotiated and awarded with a five (5)-year ordering period. In accordance with FAR 19.503, Reserves, this acquisition is being issued under one synopsis as an Unrestricted MATOC with a Small Business Reserve. The capacity of these contracts will be a combined $200M shared amongst all firms awarded contracts. USACE will award a minimum of three (3) unrestricted contracts and a minimum of three (3) Small Business contracts of any socioeconomic category. The target number of awards within each category (Large and Small Business) is four (4) contracts per category. Task orders will be competed amongst the MATOC holder?s A/E Selection procedures pursuant to FAR Subpart 36.6 in accordance with EP 715-1-7, the USACE Task Order Requirements Notification (TORN) Process, and FAR 16.505(b)(1). Small Business MATOC holders will be considered for all task orders. Unrestricted MATOC holders will be considered on task orders that are not reserved for Small Businesses. The minimum guarantee amount over the life is $5,000 for each of the MATOC contracts. Awards will be made under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services. This code currently defines the Small Business size standard as $16.5M of gross annual revenues.?

An amendment notifying firms of any change in the NAICS 541330 size standard will be issued for this synopsis should that determination be made during the solicitation period.? Firms should structure their SF330 submission accordingly. Awards are anticipated by August 2022. A firm can submit a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontractor to a Large Business on the unrestricted award.

We do note that being both a prime and subcontractor on an IDIQ can sometimes raise risks in the technical evaluation, and potential questions regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest, if both entities decide to propose on the same task order. For example, if a firm is a key subcontractor for five different proposals, it could raise questions in regards to whether the firm had the total resources to support each procurement, which could impact the technical evaluation of the offerors.?
