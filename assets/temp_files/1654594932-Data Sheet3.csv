This is a countywide contract, but the main users are Community Development Department (Code Enforcement) and the Department of Finance, Tax Collection and Licensing Division. The required reports would be equivalent to a “Litigation Guarantees Report or Trustee Sale Guarantees Report.”  However, the County of Sacramento does not require title insurance and is not requesting a formal Ligation Guarantee or Trustee Sale Guarantee.  

The contract resulting from this RFP shall be for an initial two -year period commencing with execution of the contract by the Contract and Purchasing Services.  For reasons of economy and efficiency, the County reserves the right to extend a contract three additional one-year periods, for a total of five years, upon mutual agreement between the County of Sacramento and the contractor.

The Department of Finance, Tax Collector and Licensing requires Party of Interest Reports on a batch of properties prior to their annual tax sales.  Number of reports varies significantly depending on the actual defaults for the annual sale.  The quantity has ranged in from as low as 60 properties up to 400 properties.  The Tax Collector submits these properties in one major batch each year, with the potential of one or more smaller requests at different times of the year.

Code Enforcement requires weekly Party of Interest Reports on properties.  Most requests are single properties, but sometimes include 2 or 3 properties.  Code Enforcement conducts an annual lien hearing, which could include 65 properties.  

These volumes listed above are estimates only for planning purposes.  The County may require more or less reports during any contract year and does not guarantee to request a minimum number of reports for any resulting contract.

CCDC understands that this project can serve the community with a meaningful commercial program on the ground floor and provide much-needed affordable housing for underserved seniors of all races reflective of the diversity of the City. The major challenge of the project is to achieve a financially feasible residential program on the site’s small footprint. Additionally, it will be important to bring a creative approach to finding a balance between designing a thriving commercial program and re-introducing the cultural heritage of the banquet hall. New Asia is one of the last remaining banquet halls, and it was a popular social, civic, and political gathering hub for over three decades. The design team has the exciting challenge of bringing about a transformative difference to a culturally rich and historic neighborhood.

The developer’s vision for 772 Pacific is to create a mixed-use senior residential community of more than 86 deeply affordable studio and one-bedroom units, subject to SF Planning’s feasibility determination and the project budget that MOHCD approves. We seek to create a high-quality living environment for senior households whose incomes will range between 30% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI up to 60% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI with more than half of the units for seniors with incomes at or below 30% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI. Our development will include on-site property management and resident services, front desk reception at the entry lobby, a community room for programing and events, and a neighborhood-friendly commercial component. As a rare new development, 772 Pacific will provide a tranquil refuge for seniors from Chinatown’s busy streets below while providing an opportunity for seniors to age in place with dignity. Along with the housing, responding to stakeholder input regarding the ground floor commercial use will be an integral part of the work; it is important that the project maximize affordable housing while also continuing to host a community-sustaining ground floor use.

The successful General Contractor firm(s) will demonstrate its ability to participate in a series of meetings with the developer and the design team throughout the design phases to proactively provide input on innovative building components and constructability of design for cost effective, streamlined solutions.

(2)Scope of Work for RFP: 
The developer is estimating hard construction cost around $ 60MM, which is subject to change depending on the scale of the building. 
Selected General Contractor shall provide input on the following: 
•	The team is interested in exploring emerging construction technologies that will allow the site to be developed in a cost-effective manner while balancing durability and facilitating maintenance. 
o	We will not rule out any system before understanding the cost, site, and staging implications. 
•	Units are stacked for structural efficiency and seismic safety. 
•	Recommendations for efficient residential unit layout and MOD-complying bathroom and kitchen configurations.
•	Investigate and incorporate building dimensioning to:
o	Facilitate “zero or reduced waste” during construction,
o	Facilitate the inclusion of “prefabricated walls and floor areas” that can be “efficiently craned and dropped-in-place” during construction.
•	Incorporate floor plans and exterior building envelope that can be efficiently built timewise and construction-wise. 
o	Establish an efficient ratio between window area and exterior wall area.
•	Establish efficient floor-to-floor heights. Building will comply with the all-electric Code requirements.
•	Plumbing is laid out for efficiency of plumbing runs
•	Solar power and/or other natural resources to decrease hot water heating and other energy costs 
•	Residential amenities to explore urban agricultural opportunities 
•	In addition to achieving the minimum sustainability standards of TCAC and CDLAC, CCDC is interested in exploring Passive House design standards.
•	Dos and Don’ts – Lessons learned from other affordable housing and/or MOHCD projects.

For purposes of this RFP, please indicate how long your team believes construction would last for this project. Please refer to the above schedule to inform your construction timeline. The Owner will normalize costs against construction duration among the applicant submissions, so please be mindful that this is an important part of your submission and the Owner’s calculation of your team’s overall fee and general conditions.

This public advertisement constitutes the DRPA’s formal solicitation to determine the interest of qualified firms in the Project.

The Scope of Services the Authority requires shall include construction monitoring services for the replacement and elimination of various power, signal, and communications cables running primarily within the Philadelphia tunnel of the PATCO system as well as traction-power equipment within Locust Street Substation, located in the area of the PATCO tunnel, below the concourse level and directly under Locust Street, immediately west of Broad Street, in Philadelphia.  The interested Construction Monitoring firm shall be note that the equipment replacements at Locust Street Substation represent a significant logistical challenge and that the firm will need to coordinate the work with PATCO and the Contractor to be completed successfully and without significant disruptions to PATCO’s operations.  Multi-pair copper communications cable, the use of which has diminished significantly over the years at PATCO, will be eliminated, and any communications currently carried over copper cables will be moved to existing fiber optics.  The use of multi-conductor signal cable will be reduced by converting relay-based vital signaling to microprocessor-based vital signaling, placing signal communications between instrument locations onto existing fiber optics.  In addition to electrical portion of the project, the firm will also be involved with monitoring structural repairs to PATCO’s Philadelphia tunnel.  Work will involve concrete repairs, type 1 and 2 spall repairs, crack injections, steel repairs, steel painting, and column repairs.

The selected contractor will develop a plan to update the 2017-2019 San Diego Urban Area (SDUA) Homeland Security Strategy, hereafter referred to as the “Strategy”. While the current Strategy may be used as a starting point and baseline guide for the update of this Strategy, this revised Strategy will more effectively and efficiently utilize the region’s latest Threat and Hazard identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) and Stakeholder Preparedness Report (SPR) as a central and consistent focus throughout the document. This focused method has not been included in previous updates to the Strategy.

The THIRA and SPR are the only two region-wide threat and hazard related products that are developed by City of San Diego Office of Emergency Services (OES) and required by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for periodic completion and submission, to DHS. Their use and incorporation in the development of this update to the Strategy is now emphasized and intended to ensure greater consistency in addressing and implementing regional threat and hazard priorities. This conscious and active use of the THIRA/SPR to inform the Strategy will also ensure that the regional estimates, impacts, outcomes and evaluation based on the FEMA core capabilities that these documents describe and project are more consistently reflected in the Strategy, and as a result of collaboration and coordination among the region’s homeland security stakeholders. The selected contractor will also continue to incorporate, as necessary, the risk analysis tools that have been used previously in the development of the Strategy (e.g., Cal COP products, liaison with appropriate LECC staff, and use of specialized OES maintained data bases that can all provide important inputs to the Strategy (e.g., SEAR and CIKR databases used and accessed by OES).

Solicitation Description:
Cameron County requests qualifications from engineering, architectural and consulting firms (collectively, Consultants) interested in providing professional services to conduct post-hurricane/disaster damage assessment as part of the County’s overall Post-Hurricane Recovery Operations.  The County recognizes that immediately after a major disaster, local firms might not be able to respond quickly to a request for services.  As a result, the County is interested in contracting with firms both in the local area and outside the local area to ensure that an adequate resource base is available regardless of the extent of damage within the County.  This contract shall cover calendar years 2022 through 2027.



The concept for post-hurricane recovery operations is for the County to have a number of pre-event contracts in place that will provide personnel to assist local government staffs with damage assessment activities immediately after a hurricane or other disaster.  Damage Assessment Teams (DATs) will be comprised of government and Consultant personnel under the overall direction of Cameron County staff.  The work will entail preliminary assessment and documentation of the scope and nature of damage incurred throughout the County in accordance with direction and guidance provided by the County.  The work will also include detailed documentation of damage to public property and facilities.  The work may also include assistance with repair plans and specifications and/or assistance with monitoring contractors involved in emergency protective measures.  The County will provide necessary training on the assessment process and completion of the associated forms and records.



It is the County's intent to identify qualified Consultant firms, enter into an agreement with each qualified firm, and be able to activate as many firms as necessary to provide prompt damage assessment services immediately following a hurricane or other disasters. The unpredictable nature of hurricanes or other disasters precludes providing more detailed descriptions of the actual work assignments at this time.



The primary focus of the pre-positioned contracts is post-hurricane and other /disaster recovery operations.  Notwithstanding, the County may activate the same contracts for response to any disaster, natural or man-made, regardless of the scope of damage.  The County may contact any of the Consultants under contract at any time for assistance in this area.  The intent is that the firm will provide personnel to the extent of their capabilities at the time of the request.  Submitters should consider this concept."

Bid Description: Tourism is one of the largest economic sectors in Vermont, welcoming over 13 million visitors each year who account for close to $3 billion in annual spending on lodging, food and drink, goods, and services. While Summertime is the busiest time of year for tourism, Vermont is a four-season destination for domestic and international visitors. The state is famous around the world for its beautiful fall foliage colors, when tourists flock to Vermont’s byways to enjoy the spectacular change of seasons. During the winter months, Vermont’s world class ski resorts are the most popular destination in the Northeast for skiing and riding. In springtime, Vermont is consistently the top producer of maple syrup in the country. The current website hosts over 1.2M sessions and over 2M page views on a yearly basis. Most visitors to the site are new users, to the tune of about 900K new users every year. We estimate that the site currently includes approximately 750+ pages and the site library includes over 2000 images. VermontVacation.com has been in its current state since transitioning to a mobile friendly solution in 2013. Prior to this, the site remained in Sitecore as a desktop site. The current implementation is limited by VDTM team access to css, layouts, and other functionalities necessary for digital marketing. Through this Request for Proposal (RFP), the Agency of Digital Services on behalf of the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing (hereinafter the “State”) is seeking to establish contracts with one or more companies to plan, design, deploy, host, and provide ongoing support for a new website implementation of VermontVacation.com that inspires visitation to the state of Vermont. If you are interested in submitting a bid, please go to the following web site: http://bgs.vermont.gov/purchasing-contracting/bid-info Here you will find the bid documents ready to be downloaded. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ALL NOTIFICATIONS, RELEASES AND AMENDMENTS WILL BE POSTED HERE. THE STATE WILL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO CONTACT VENDORS WITH UPDATED INFORMATION.

Project Name: Abandoned Property Registration Program - Annual

Scope of Work: 1.1. Lee County Board of County Commissioners seeks to contract with a qualified Vendor to administer an Abandoned Property Registration Program.

1.2. The purpose of this project is to establish an electronic registration process to limit and reduce the deterioration of property located within unincorporated Lee County, as contemplated by Lee County Ordinance 13-18. The mortgagee of a distressed property is required to register the property with the County.  A property is distressed if it is under mortgage default; under a notice of mortgagee’s sale or pending sale has been the subject of a mortgage foreclosure sale where title is retained by the mortgagee; or title has been transferred to a mortgagee under deed-in-lieu of foreclosure sale, short sale, or any other legal means.  This registration program is a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance, or through distressed and/or abandoned properties that are subject to mortgages in default.

Operational Description The Army plans to continue modernization of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).? AFATDS provides the Army and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects and provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapons systems. As a member of the Artillery System Cooperation Agreement (ASCA), AFATDS is interoperable with coalition partner fire support systems. The currently fielded AFATDS 6.8 baseline automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).? AFATDS 7.0 (currently under development) transitions the Ada backend to Java and will provide improved cyber security, embedded training, a refreshed UI and backend improvements which will simplify sustainment and maintenance.? ?AFATDS 7.1 will expand on the benefits provided by AFATDS 7.0 by providing more robust front end changes, expanded embedded training, various sensor to shooter enhancements, and support for next generation munitions and additional backend changes for improved maintainability Requirements PM MC is seeking responses from interested parties that provide insights into how industry may go about meeting the AFATDS requirements as described within this RFI. Specific areas that responses should focus on are as follows: Opportunities and options for alignment with the Command Post Computing Environment Architectural changes to AFATDS to better support cloud computing hosting options Decomposition of key AFATDS functionality to be exposed as microservice based containers to improve overall system modularity and maintainability Backwards Compatibility with prior versions of AFATDS Improved usability to user facing interfaces Embedded training of key software features to provide 24/7/365 access to training IPV6 support Resolve known issues within AFATDS MIL-STD-2525D compliance Incorporating new munitions within AFATDS Applicable intellectual property/data rights related factors associated with proposed paths forward should be highlighted as part of all responses.

As a result, USACE contracting offices that are currently using other file drop services (e.g., DoD SAFE) are beginning to discontinue the use of these tools and beginning to transition to the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Solicitation Module.? This capability allows USACE to have a more automated and secure process for capturing solicitations and their attachments and responses from industry.? PIEE?s Solicitation Module enables posting of solicitations to a widespread or restricted audience. This includes the ability to post draft or final solicitations, amendments, and attachments. Government users can designate either the entire solicitation or specific attachments as limited to use by specific companies. Contractors are able to submit their proposals via the portal, and contracting personnel are then able to use the portal to distribute proposals to reviewers. In preparation for full implementation of the PIEE Solicitation Module, we recommend that all Contractors doing business with USACE access the PIEE Solicitation Module Vendor Access Instructions (https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/docs/PIEE/PIEE_Solicitation_Module_Vendor_Access_Instructions.pdf) and either self-register for a PIEE account and add the appropriate roles, or for existing PIEE users, access their account and add additional roles.? There are two vendor roles (Proposal Manager, Proposal View Only) for the PIEE Solicitation Module. The Proposal Manager role is required to submit an offer to a solicitation posted in the PIEE Solicitation Module.?

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, nor is it an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business set-aside is possible for the required services.

General Electric Aviation, LLC (GEAS) is the only source that can provide this since they acquired Smiths Aerospace, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the RDC. The OEM supplier, provided RDC units under contract N00019-13-D-0018. To remain relevant in the current combat environment, AV-8B RDC hardware and software must work together to accurately display all symbols on the Heads Up Display (HUD) and Multi-Purpose Color Displays (MPCD) required for effective operation and mission prosecution. The RDC is unable to display all symbols when symbol intense formats are attempted to be displayed. This display limitation prevents required information from being displayed to the pilot that limits the combat effectiveness and safe operation of the AV-8B Harrier.

SF Environment is seeking qualified suppliers (“Proposers”) to provide proposals for the administration and facilitation of Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meetings (Proposal). 
SF Environment creates visionary policies and innovative programs that promote social equity, protect human health, and lead the way toward a sustainable future. We put our mission into action by mobilizing communities and providing the resources needed to safeguard our homes, our city, and ultimately our planet. SF Environment does this by developing innovative, practical and wide-ranging environmental programs, fostering groundbreaking legislation, and educating the public by providing comprehensive and easily accessible information on a wide range of sustainable practices.  
SF Environment’s Clean Transportation team is establishing a new Medium- and Heavy-Duty (“MD/HD”) Zero Emission Vehicle (“ZEV”) Technical Advisory Committee (“TAC”). The TAC will bring together public sector stakeholders, utilities, City departments, community-based organizations, local businesses, and fleet representatives directly engaged in MD/HD fleet electrification in San Francisco to guide the development of the San Francisco MD/HD ZEV Blueprint. The TAC will provide a forum for coordination and collaboration to ensure that stakeholders can inform and review key Blueprint components.
The TAC will: 
•	Provide an opportunity for all members to aid in the design, development, and review of the Blueprint components and final Blueprint; 
•	Discuss challenges to fleet electrification and the impacts of charging siting and installation on the community; 
•	Share data, best-practices, and messaging to develop cohesive solutions that support the Blueprint’s goals; and 
•	Provide oversight to ensure that the resulting Blueprint and its contents fulfill their needs, address their concerns and interests, and are implementable within the allocated timeframe.
SF Environment is looking for a contractor with experience in facilitating in-person and virtual stakeholder meetings in a professional, inclusive, and collaborative manner. The TAC meeting facilitator will design and facilitate TAC meetings, with the purpose of moving TAC members towards a common goal. The facilitator will foster collaboration and teamwork and manage conflict among members. The facilitator will coordinate, lead, and support all phases of team meetings to ensure progression and completion of work as well as supports the SF Environment project lead, and is accountable for the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of TAC meetings. Having a neutral, third-party facilitator is important to the success of the meetings because a facilitator will provide a structured, inclusive space for group members to be productive, creative, and efficient.

In December 2021, NASA announced the extension of the International Space Station (ISS) to 2030. These additional missions are needed in order to enable NASA to meet its mission requirements to maintain crew onboard the ISS and to meet obligations under agreements with its International Partners. According to the NASA Authorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 810 (Feb. 9, 2015)), ?It is the policy of the United States to maintain an uninterrupted capability for human space flight and operations in low-Earth orbit, and beyond, as an essential instrument of national security and the capability to ensure continued United States participation and leadership in the exploration and utilization of space.? NASA has CCtCap contracts with Boeing and SpaceX. SpaceX is the only known source of a Crew Transportation System (CTS) that has been certified by NASA to provide crew transportation services to the ISS. SpaceX has launched four PCMs to the ISS. Due to the technical and schedule challenges experienced by Boeing, the number of missions previously awarded to Boeing and SpaceX, NASA projections of when alternative crew transportation systems will be available, and the technical challenges associated with establishing and maintaining a CTS capability for crewed flights to the ISS approximately every six months, it is necessary to award five additional PCMs to SpaceX. In addition, awarding five additional PCMs to SpaceX will ensure redundant and backup capabilities through 2030, which is essential for the following reasons: (i) the obligation to provide continuous flight availability for the safe operation of the ISS; (ii) the potential for anomalies or accidents; (iii) the potential for unforeseen external factors; and, (iv) risks associated with the design of a safe and reliable CTS.? The anomaly with the Boeing Orbital Flight Test (OFT) and subsequent technical issues that led to delays of the OFT-2 and subsequent flights demonstrate the importance of having redundant and back-up capabilities in order for NASA to meet its mission requirements to maintain crew onboard the ISS and to meet its obligations under agreements with its International partners to assure continued crewed access to the ISS. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort electronically via email to Brian Hinerth at brian.s.hinerth@nasa.gov and Joseph Bell at joseph.m.bell@nasa.gov not later than 5:00PM EDT on June 16, 2022. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this acquisition on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf? An RFI was posted on October 20, 2021, requesting information from industry to help NASA formulate an acquisition approach for the procurement of additional PCMs. Responses to the October 20, 2021 RFI and any information received in response to this NOI will be used to inform NASA?s planning for an acquisition approach.? ?"

Presently, the M2A1 includes a flash hider for signature reduction. The M2A1 suppressor should maintain or reduce current flash levels, but also reduce sound and ground / environmental disturbance while not significantly increasing the thermal signature. Suppressor designs should minimize toxic fumes at the gunner?s face. Suppressors should not significantly decrease the weapon?s cyclic rate of fire or affect weapon?s ability to successfully function when firing M33 / M17 Ball/Tracer. Suppressors will also be evaluated for their compatibility with M903 / M962 Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP)/Tracer. The sound reduction of the suppressor should provide 6 dB or more reduction in peak, unweighted sound at the shooter's ear. Suppressor solutions can be removable or non-removable, and both quick disconnect and non-quick disconnect removal is acceptable. Integral barrel / suppressor systems are also acceptable. An integrally suppressed barrel should be interchangeable with an unsuppressed barrel. Offerors should note if their suppressor solution requires any changes to the weapon system to meet functional requirements. Any changes should be detailed by Offerors in their response and be included as a kit with installation instructions with their suppressor. Solutions that can achieve the same performance without the need to modify the weapon system are preferred. Suppressors will be assessed for endurance life with a focus on preventing any safety issues as the suppressor approaches end-of-life (i.e. potential for blockages or structural failure). Suppressors will be assessed under an endurance duty cycle on the M2A1 consisting of 50 rounds of M33 ball caliber .50 caliber cartridges, linked with M9 links, fired in short, spasmodic bursts followed by an additional 50 rounds fired in a sustained, continuous burst. The barrel shall be cooled to below 300 degrees Fahrenheit after firing each 100 rounds. The suppressor should reduce ground disturbance of the M2A1, as characterized by changes in the amount of sand the suppressor kicks up, or movement in tall grass, while firing from a M205 or M3 tripod. SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Interested companies who believe they are capable of providing M2A1 suppressors that meet the above goals are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary (i.e. no more than 10 pages -- not counting prior contract history) of their company?s specific suppressor design and any supporting analysis or test results that show the ability to meet the above goals. ?The Government is not funding developmental programs, and requests Offerors only respond with their operational material solutions deliverable within 4 months of request (including Technology Ready Level).? Please include information on lead times and estimated cost to produce and deliver small quantities of suppressors (maximum of 10) for evaluation by the government. Also, please provide information on the ability to scale up manufacturing and production in higher quantities.? Companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data, as well as identification of current customers. ?A TECHNICAL DATA PACKAGE (TDP) OR GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IN SUPPORT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ?Please identify the subject of your response as, ?M2A1 Suppressor?.

VA Loma Linda Healthcare System is seeking to provide Radiopharmaceutical Supplies-NETSPOT (Gallium 68 Dotatate). 2.2. Background. All Radiopharmaceutical Supplies shall be provided in accordance with the terms and conditions, and provisions of this solicitation for the base year period with the Government s option to extend the contract for four (4) additional one-year periods. 2.3. Scope. The supplies must have the following salient characteristics: . Ga 68 Dotatate injection, a radioactive diagnostic agent for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This radioactive probe is used for diagnosing and staging to find Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) throughout the body. Gallium-68 decays with a half-life of 68 minutes to stable zinc Zn 68 10% through orbital electron capture (X-ray or Auger emissions), and 3% through 13 gamma transitions from 5 exited levels. The effective radiation dose resulting from the administration of 150 MBq (4.05 mCi) [within the range of the recommended Ga 68 Dotatate injection dose] to an adult weighing 75 kg, is about 3.15 mSv. For an administered activity of 150 MBq (4.05 mCi) the typical radiation dose to the critical organs, which are the urinary bladder wall, the spleen and the kidneys/adrenals, are about 18, 16 and 12 mGy, respectively. Because the spleen has one of the highest physiological uptakes, higher uptake and radiation dose to other organs or pathologic tissues may occur in patients with splenectomy. Physical data Gamma constant: 0.67 mrem/hr per mCi at 1 meter [1.8E-4 mSv/hr per MBq at 1 meter]. Specific Activity: 4.1E7 Ci/g [1.51E18 Bq/g] max 2.

Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this rapid separation of Ta-185 radioisotopes technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Short-lived radioisotopes are important for any application aiming to limit a radiological dose. Most radiopharmaceuticals have half-lives of several days as the time required between production, separation, drug incorporation, and delivery to the patient can take several days to a week. INL?s technology would accelerate this process by producing the isotopes on-demand at the point of use. By introducing a fast separation method, the total isotope preparation time would be reduced drastically to only ~1-2 hours. Description:?? ?INL?s technology utilizes nuclear instrumentation and a modular rapid chemical separation system developed at INL to produce ultra-short-lived radionuclides such as Ta-185, in-house and on-demand. The key features of the method are production of Ta-185 via irradiation of W-186 with a linear accelerator, an optimized irradiation method for maximum Ta-185 production and rapid chemical separation technique utilizing a stream-lined rapid chromatographic isotope separation system (S-RCISS) to quickly separate and isolate Ta-185. Benefits:??? ?????? Novel separation system drastically surpassing rapidity of current systems. The rapid separation allows on-site and on-demand production of radioisotopes. ? Applications:?? Radioisotope applications. Opens up a new market for ultra-short-lived radioisotope applications. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is an early-stage concept and needs further testing. IP Status: ??????? Provisional Patent Application No. 63/203,858, ?Methods for Producing Radionuclides Using Accelerator Bremsstrahlung Irradiation and Rapid Chromatographic Isotope Separation,? BEA Docket No. 1252 Additional Information INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities. Please visit Technology Deployment?s website at https://inl.gov/inl-initiatives/technology-deployment for more information on working with INL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. Companies interested in learning more about this licensing opportunity should contact Andrew Rankin at td@inl.gov."
