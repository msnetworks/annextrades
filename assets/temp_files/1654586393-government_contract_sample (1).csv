The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is seeking sources for?a construction project titled: Walla Walla District Headquarters Building Fireproofing Upgrade. The work is located in Walla Walla County,?Washington. This will be a firm-fixed-price construction contract. Performance and Payment bonds will be required. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 238310 - Fire sprinkler system installation, and the associated small business size standard is $16,500,000.? This sources-sought announcement is a tool to identify interested businesses with the technical experience and capability to accomplish this work. This is not a solicitation. Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement. Please do not respond to this notice unless you intend to respond to the solicitation.? A.) Provide a capability statement expressing interest in this requirement, a list of no more than five current or past projects demonstrating technicalexperience with work of a similar nature to that listed in the Summary of Scope of Work.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 10:00 AM Pacific Time on May 3, 2022.? Summary of Scope of Work:? The current Walla Walla Headquarter Building has been in use for about 27 years after the original Walla Walla Headquarters relocated to the new building in 1995. The firestopping measurements put in place during the original construction of the building are critical to the safety of personnel, as such measures keep fire and smoke out of certain designated areas. The FY21 inspection revealed several rooms in the HQ building have insufficient firestopping measures and can?t meet the 1-hour rating requirements. Ducts, piping, conduit, and wires are improperly sealed as they penetrate horizontally through walls and vertically through ceilings.

These magnets will be used to bend and focus high energy and high intensity electron beams in the EIC rapid cycling electron synchrotron ring (RCS) and the EIC electron storage ring (ESR). Both TJNAF and BNL will be responsible for the final design, procurement, and quality assurance of different magnet families for the EIC project. EIC can refer to either lab with respect to the magnet procurements. BNL will be responsible for the final installation and commissioning of the magnets in the EIC complex. While it is anticipated installation and commissioning will primarily be a BNL responsibility, JLab and our satellite system supplier(s) will certainly have some involvement in those phases as well to ensure the proper installation and startup of the magnets. This combined pre-solicitation notice, sources sought request and request for information (RFI) communication is a critical first step in our path to success. Its intent is to bring our industry partners into the loop as early in the process as possible prior to release of any formal requests for proposal(s) (RFP) that we anticipate releasing in the next 12 to 24 months. As you will see from the questions we will be posing, we would like industry to have some input into the process with potential influence on the strategy, specifications, and supporting documentation as they get finalized prior to any RFP(s).

Dear Sir or Madam,

Please note this Qualification System was originally advertised as per live link https://irl.eu-supply.com/ctm/Supplier/PublicPurchase/175004/0/0?returnUrl=ctm/Supplier/publictenders&b=ETENDERS_SIMPLE (../../ctm/Supplier/PublicPurchase/175004/0/0?returnUrl=ctm/Supplier/publictenders&b=ETENDERS_SIMPLE) published on 07/10/2020 TED Reference: (https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:478141-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0) but the RFT was not originally advertised as a DPS tender, therefore I am now re advertising re RFT177249 which will link both RFT??s

Iarnród ?ireann (I?) invites applications from suitably qualified companies to participate in the pre-qualification process to establish a Qualification System for Asset Inspection Services. Iarnród ?ireann (I?) is seeking suitable expertise to carry out safety critical technical inspections across a number of asset bases, through the engagement of suitably qualified consultants.

The Contract the subject of this competition refers to the establishment of a Qualification System for 3 years with an option to extend annually for up to 2 additional years at IE??s discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the Contract.

Those companies successfully appointed to the Qualification System will receive all future tender enquiries.

Applicants interested in participating in the procurement process must complete and return the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) which is appended to this notice

Please note the closing date on the PQQ cover sheet 2nd November 2020 is incorrect, IE can accept PQQ???s up to 15/10/2023 ref section 1.2 of the PQQ

If you have any queries please send me a message through the messaging function on etenders.

The HPLC instrument will need to have a built in autosampler system. This pump system is flow rate agile and can accommodate flow rates and pressures typically used in traditional HPLC application while being able to accommodate the lower flow rates and higher pressure needed for UPLC applications. The pump will handle flow rates from 0.001 ml/minute up to 5 ml/minute. At 0.001 ml/minute (1ul/minute) the flow accuracy for this pump is 0.1%. This pump system will allow the University to do both semi-preparative work and high resolution, low sample consumption methods. The pump can use and mix on the fly up to four different solvents and includes two separate fluid flow paths plus a waste path. The mixing accuracy for the lowest flow rate is a mere +/- 0.5%. The pump system must also include a column heater/cooler system. This will create consistent conditions for each method and minimizes run-to-run errors based on ambient conditions. Second, we are looking for the system to include a Photodiode Array UV-vis detector. The PDA not only allows the user to monitor multiple wavelengths at once but also records the entire UV-vis spectrum during the course of the chromatographic run. Additionally we wish all suppliers to include a nitrogen generator. Typically, MS systems require ultra-pure nitrogen to function. The nitrogen generator can also be used to supply gas to other instruments as needed. Overview of the eRFQ ProcessThe objective of the eRFQ is to select one or more qualified suppliers to provide the goods and/or services outlined in this eRFQ to the State Entity. This eRFQ process will be conducted to gather and evaluate responses from supplier for potential award."

"Trades and Subcontracts: HVAC, Refrigeration, Mechanical Bids",UT,Minuteman III (MMIII) Brine Chiller Purge/Flush Process,Federal,,Department of Defense,13-05-2022,Department of Defense,https://sam.gov/opp/c3cad3042ef14ca0baf980cbd65ce7f5/view,MMIII_Brine_Chiller_,Purchasing,,703-695-7145,dan.scheer@us.af.mil,,"NOTICE:? This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes only. Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? Rather, the purpose of this RFI is to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.? A determination by the Government not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. BACKGROUND: The Air Force (AF) has need to modernize the HVAC Purge/Flush Process and Equipment used to maintain MMIII in addition to the transition to the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ??The AF would like to obtain information to understand if processes and equipment are available and obtainable. The purpose of this RFI is two-fold. The first purpose is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be a full and open competition and/or a total small business set-aside.? The Government is looking at several North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) codes; 238220 HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-condition) contractors or 423730 HVAC equipment merchant wholesales. ?If an alternate NAICS code is recommended, please provide the recommendation in the response.? The AF is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.? The AF requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable, and identify your business status to the identified NAICS code (see the Section labeled ?Responses? for response requirements).? Additionally, please provide any potential teaming arrangements.? Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The second purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about schedule, cost, and other aspects of this potential procurement from the perspectives of development and implementation. DESCRIPTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) maintains ICBM?s in the northern United States. In an effort to establish greater warfighter capabilities multiple systems are capable of initiating ICBM launches. The Brine Chiller Purge is used to ensure the HVAC equipment will be sufficient to sustain MMIII and through the transition to GBSD through acquisition (and modification as needed) of required equipment. The legacy/current process and equipment for evacuating and dehydrating, checking the refrigerant pressure, and reclaiming and servicing the LF and MAF Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-systems are using these available industry parts: Yellow Jacket (PN21012) oil changing pump SPX Robinair Vacuum Pump (PN 15600) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Reclaimer (PN 17800B) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Receiver Tank (PN 17121) The process, in conjunction with using the parts listed above, takes maintenance technicians an average 3-5 days to complete.? A bench checkout on the Brine Chiller is conducted post servicing the Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-system.? CAPABILITIES:? Field and/or Apprentice Technician level and/or skill set Basic HVAC Principle Training focus on ECS and EPA regulation List hazardous and/or flammable materials List of general, specialty, and/or sole source equipment and materials Vacuum operating level maximum must be below and hold below 500 Microns no less than 5-minutes; no minimum level purge or holding requirement Overall timeline for completing process must be less than 3-days with a bench check? process ideally less than but no more than 4 hours (i.e. 2-hours under low heat load and 2-hours under high heat load) Operating procedures and/or user?s manual ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED: Provide a schedule from contract award through qualification and implementation Provide an estimate cost range as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) from contract award through qualification and implementation. RESPONSES: Responsible and capable sources may identify their interest by providing a white paper capability statement (limited to 10 pages) with sufficient information to substantiate respondents have all of the capabilities listed in Capabilities and answering all questions. ?Please see the section for Eligibility Requirement. Government will consider responses to one or all of the purposes depending on company?s capability. ADDITIONAL NOTICES: Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? A determination by the AF not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the AF. ?The AF will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.? ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT: The distribution of the draft specification and top level drawings is limited to contractors with a DD 2345 certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service, Joint Certification Program (1-877-352-2255) and who have a legitimate business purpose. As such, WBS cannot be provided to a contractor without a certification. Contractors who would like to become certified can find the form and instructions at: https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx. Interested parties are advised that certification of a DD Form 2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form as soon as possible is highly recommended.

Interested parties will provide industry solutions for inspection of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?) in a marine environment. Many commercial off the shelf (COTS) products in the industries of sewer, heat exchanger, and pipe manufacturing inspection fulfill most but not all of the desired requirements. ? Interested companies with the technologies capable of meeting the desired general requirements may submit responses that include products current and expected capabilities with modifications. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will reimburse no costs associated with response to this RFI. B.?? ?BACKGROUND The US Navy is seeking information on the industry capabilities for inspection system of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?). ?This pipe will be referred to as a guide or stowage tube, and is part of a system that a Towed Array travels through on deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection systems major components would consist of a user control system, inspection device, and cable storage. ?This system would need to be portable so it could be deployed and setup pier side to access the entry point on the vessel. ?Power would be provided by a battery and/or use standard 120 VAC 60Hz power. ?The maximum working length needed to inspect a guide or stowage tube will account for distance from system user control station to entry of guide or stowage tube. ?Diver support would be used to assist the inspection effort and access the guide or stowage tube entry point. ?Due to limitations of access, an inspection device using internal sensors is preferred, as clearance for external sensors is limited. ?Along the inspection run, the inspection device must traverse a minimum bend radius. ?These bend radius sections are through roller box assemblies, which consist of rollers made of Delrin, which reduce friction through these turns during deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection device would need to be waterproof and operate in a marine environment (regular immersion in salt water). ?This desired inspection device must be able to provide visual and measurement data of reasonable resolution in real time via a user control station and save this data for post analysis using a removable storage device. ?Accurate measurement would be expected for the following conditions of the stowage or guide tube: ?submerged in saltwater, partially submerged, or empty. ?Data collection is expected to be completed in a work day (8-12 Hrs.), for the required length of guide or stowage tube. ?The systems provided software program can be used to view visual and measurement data in real time. ?The location of the inspection device would be tracked and used to mark locations of interest for post analysis. ?This program could also be used to export data to commonly available software using removable storage media. ?For post analysis, standalone PC software is used to analyze ?raw? data from inspection system to generate a CAD file or inspection report. The small diameter pipe is part of either a Thinline or Fatline Towed Array Handling System (TAHS). ?Where the pipe is referred to as a guide tube in a Thinline system, and stowage tube in a Fatline system. ?The primary differences between these two systems is working length, pipe diameter, minimum bend radius, and presence of roller boxes. ?Requirements will be separated for inspection of each handing system, however there is interest in an inspection system capable of meeting the combined requirements of each handling system. Authorized personnel will provide feedback and any technical data necessary to facilitate responses on industry capabilities. C.?? ?REQUIREMENTS The following are the requirements of the inspection system: ? See Attached Thinline Guide Tube Inspection Requirements See Attached Fatline Stowage Tube Inspection Requirements 1. Thinline Towed Array Handling System: Measure Pipe Size: 2.00 in. Nominal Diameter Min. Bend Radius: 4 ft. Travel Through Roller Boxes: YES Max. Device Size: 1.45 in.

Interested parties will provide industry solutions for inspection of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?) in a marine environment.

Interested companies with the technologies capable of meeting the desired general requirements may submit responses that include products current and expected capabilities with modifications. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will reimburse no costs associated with response to this RFI. B.?? ?BACKGROUND The US Navy is seeking information on the industry capabilities for inspection system of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?). ?This pipe will be referred to as a guide or stowage tube, and is part of a system that a Towed Array travels through on deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection systems major components would consist of a user control system, inspection device, and cable storage. ?This system would need to be portable so it could be deployed and setup pier side to access the entry point on the vessel. ?Power would be provided by a battery and/or use standard 120 VAC 60Hz power. ?The maximum working length needed to inspect a guide or stowage tube will account for distance from system user control station to entry of guide or stowage tube. ?Diver support would be used to assist the inspection effort and access the guide or stowage tube entry point. ?Due to limitations of access, an inspection device using internal sensors is preferred, as clearance for external sensors is limited. ?Along the inspection run, the inspection device must traverse a minimum bend radius. ?These bend radius sections are through roller box assemblies, which consist of rollers made of Delrin, which reduce friction through these turns during deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection device would need to be waterproof and operate in a marine environment (regular immersion in salt water). ?This desired inspection device must be able to provide visual and measurement data of reasonable resolution in real time via a user control station and save this data for post analysis using a removable storage device. ?Accurate measurement would be expected for the following conditions of the stowage or guide tube: ?submerged in saltwater, partially submerged, or empty. ?Data collection is expected to be completed in a work day (8-12 Hrs.), for the required length of guide or stowage tube. ?The systems provided software program can be used to view visual and measurement data in real time. ?The location of the inspection device would be tracked and used to mark locations of interest for post analysis. ?This program could also be used to export data to commonly available software using removable storage media. ?For post analysis, standalone PC software is used to analyze ?raw? data from inspection system to generate a CAD file or inspection report. The small diameter pipe is part of either a Thinline or Fatline Towed Array Handling System (TAHS). ?Where the pipe is referred to as a guide tube in a Thinline system, and stowage tube in a Fatline system. ?The primary differences between these two systems is working length, pipe diameter, minimum bend radius, and presence of roller boxes. ?Requirements will be separated for inspection of each handing system, however there is interest in an inspection system capable of meeting the combined requirements of each handling system. Authorized personnel will provide feedback and any technical data necessary to facilitate responses on industry capabilities.
