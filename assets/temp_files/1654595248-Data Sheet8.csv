REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the VALVE,CHECK furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;80064 803-1385637; cage ;80064 803-1385637-062AF(MOD); . 3.1.1 ;(MOD) - A 1/8 inch diameter hole to be drilled in the Disc, PC 17 of Drawing 803-1385637, to provide priming flow to the standby service pump.; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5. PACKAGING 5.1 Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below.

The length of these test specimen fasteners must meet the minimum specified in table 1 of ASTM-F606 but must not exceed it by more than 1/4 inch. Test specimen fasteners must be the same type, style, and diameter as the production lot and must be manufactured from the same starting material, using the same manufacturing techniques as the production lot, and must be heat treated (if required) along with the production lot. 3.7 Contract Support Library - Additional requirements for this item are identified as Contract Support Library Reference Number ;CSD200 and CSD205; in ECDS at https://register.nslc.navy.mil/ 3.8 Thrust Washer Material - Thrust washer, ;piece 8 on NAVSEA drawing 803-4385051; to be Nylatron GSVQ-II (Nylon 66 with molybdenum disulfide) in accordance with MIL-DTL-32286, as manufactured by Quadrant Engineering Plastic Products (EPP). 3.9 A visual inspection shall be performed on the finished seat with acceptance criteria on critical surfaces per CSD167 in the ECDS (Electronic Contractor Data Submission) system at: https://register.nslc.navy.mil/. 3.10 K-MONEL Fasteners - Material must be heat treated per QQ-N-286. 3.10.1 Fasteners that have been hot or cold headed or roll threaded must be solution annealed followed by age hardening subsequent to all heading and thread rolling operations. The mechanical properties on certifications must be actual properties of the annealed and age hardened material and must meet the requirements of QQ-N-286. 3.10.2 QQ-N-286 fasteners that have been headed and/or roll threaded must not beage hardened unless the material has been solution annealed subsequent to the heading and threading operations. Threads formed after the final age hardening heat treatment must be cut or ground only. 3.11 K-MONEL Fasteners - K-MONEL externally threaded fasteners must have mechanical properties determined in accordance with MIL-DTL-1222. Test results must include Tensile, Yield, Elongation and Hardness as required by MIL-DTL-1222. (The Hardness tests must be performed on a full size fastener.) 3.11.1 Studs require an Axial Tensile test in accordance with MIL-DTL-1222. 3.11.2 Headed fasteners require a Wedge Tensile test as specified elsewhere in this contract/purchase order. 3.12 Seat Stack Height Measurement - To ensure that each seat is within tolerance, check each seat singularly by measuring the seat height over the ball. This measurement is calculated by adding one-half ball diameter to the half stack height dimension on the drawing. Limits are determined by the ball diameter tolerance and the half stack height tolerance. Check dimensions by measuring from the seat back face to top of ball. Manufacturers of seats that do not have a ball of the required size available will be required to manufacture a dummy ball or segment of a ball with sufficient spherical surface to check the above dimension. 3.13 Internal Threads - All internal threads must be formed by cutting. Cold forming of internal threads is not acceptable. 3.14 Thread Inspection Requirements - All threads on threaded parts must be inspected using appropriate inspection methods, inspection systems, and inspection gages/instruments in accordance with FED-STD-H28 series. Substitution of thecommercial equivalent inspection in accordance with ASME B1 series is acceptable. 3.14.1 System 21 of FED-STD-H28/20 must be used as a minimum inspection requirement for threads when the design drawing or design specification does not specify an inspection requireme..."

TO RECEIVE A PRINTED COPY OF THE SOLICITATION, call: HelpLine at 651.296.2600 (for persons with speech or hearing disabilities, 711 or 1.800.627.3529 MN Relay Service) or fax your request to 651.297.3996, Attn: HelpLine.

NOTES:  

This is a single source posting notification; there are no solicitation documents for download. Note this posting is not a Request for Bid (RFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP).

The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) intends to extend an agreement with AmeriTrak Fleet Solutions for twelve (12) months to continue to provide an Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) System, which consists of hardware, software, and maintenance services. The AVL collects and transmits information to and from MnDOT fleet vehicles, and has the capacity of storing and creating records of these transmissions. MnDOT has a perpetual license for the operation and use of an unrestricted number of these devices and any related software.

This is deemed a single source purchase because this equipment uses proprietary software which MnDOT is licensed to use. Such software licenses cannot be transferred to another vendor or agency. If this equipment is not continued, then a replacement system would require new software development to meet needs specific to MnDOT. The current AmeriTrak equipment meets MnDOTs specific needs because of the joint software development.

If there are any concerns regarding this single source opportunity, contact Dale Stevens at dale.stevens@state.mn.us before 6/8/2022 at 2:00PM Central Time. Include the reference number and title of the posting in the subject line. Or you may call the HelpLine at 651.296.2600 (MN Relay Service for persons with speech or hearing disabilities: 711 or 1.800.627.3529) or fax your request to 651.297.3996, ATTN: HelpLine.

Project Description

The City of Sumner recently adopted the Sumner Main Street Visioning Plan.  That plan identified improvements to Sumners Main Street including to Heritage Park, the Ryan House, the alleys, and Main Street. 

Heritage Park: Consistent with the Main Street Visioning Plan, Heritage Park will expand from its current footprint to be approximately 0.75 acres, the full block. Streetscape around Heritage Park is being constructed in 2022/2023, but the park itself has not been recently master planned to truly serve as the heart of the city both during events and every day. 

Alley Activation: The Main Street Visioning Plan identified a need to upgrade and better utilize the current alleys as multipurpose areas. In addition to their current role for transportation/accessing businesses, they will be developed as gathering spaces for pedestrian walkways, events, and other pop-up uses. Through this project, the alley between Kincaid Avenue and Alder Avenue will be developed to shovel-ready construction plans that also set a broad design for all other alleys.

Wayfinding Signs: The city needs to upgrade signs that direct drivers to key areas and public parking. This package also reworks signage for public parking lots to clearly identify them. The city already has a graphic design package for this project. This portion will take graphic design and design the final sign elements (posts, materials, etc.) to prepare this project for a sign shop to construct.

The consultants tasks may include, but are not limited to public outreach, survey, geotechnical work, civil design, lighting design, cultural resources, traffic impact analysis, and ROW acquisition as needed to develop the Master Plan and alley design with potential phasing, including engineering drawings, specifications, cost estimates, preparation of bid-ready construction contract documents and construction management/support.  WSDOT standard specifications and Sumner Development Standards serve as the basis for City of Sumner contracts. Project specifications shall be completed in WSDOT format.

The Master Plan and alley design may include a community center, stage, playground, plaza, sound system, lawn space, picnic areas, lighting, permanent parking, restroom facilities, walkways, landscaping, and other amenities.  Requirements for frontage or other improvements will be determined through the design process and included in the corresponding phases of development.

The city desires to include Green Stormwater Infrastructure, utilizing permeable pavements and bioretention to the maximum extent practicable.

Upon award of the contract, the consultant shall propose a project schedule with completion of the alley design by December 31, 2022, to meet grant requirements.

The consultant will coordinate with the Citys Communications Division before developing any outreach to efficiently align any project efforts with the Citys ongoing communications. Typical efforts include but are not limited to updating the Sumner Connects project page, gaining feedback at the Citys open house(s), providing clear information for newsletter, e-newsletter and social media.  See Communications/Engagement Consultants Guide for Success.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Divisions intends to issue a modification to the previously awarded sole source contract to Utah State University (USU), 2300 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322, (CAGE code: 4B969 USU) extending the period of performance from 36 months (12/19/2019-12/18/2022) to 60 months (12/19/2019-12/18/2024) to develop synthetic bio-inspired materials for propeller occlusion, including but not limited to spider silk thread, spider silk sponges, hagfish slime proteins, and hagfish slime intermediate filaments for Maritime Vessel Stopping Occlusion Technologies (MVSOT).? USU will synthetically reproduce natural spider silk and hagfish slime proteins, then process into spider silk thread, spider silk-based sponges, and hagfish slime intermediate filaments for propeller occlusion applications.? USU will provide subject matter expertise on bio-inspired materials and synthetic production of bio-inspired materials.? This contract action will include an additional two (2) Options of 12 months each.? This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. ? ?USU is the only responsible source capable of providing the required material in the required schedule.? Under the current contract N61331-20-D-0001, USU successfully synthesized and provided support for synthetic hagfish slime proteins, synthetic hagfish intermediate filament fiber, synthetic spider silk and synthetic spider silk-based sponges for propeller occlusion under Maritime Vessel Stopping Occlusion technologies (MVSOT). ? This acquisition is of previously developed and highly specialized materials.? This effort builds upon previous contract efforts and seeks to progress the technology by scaling up production to larger quantities for in-water testing.? USU has decades of experience developing synthetic spider silk proteins; this experience is unique in the bio-inspired materials industry and directly allowed USU to successfully reproduce synthetic hagfish slime proteins in lab scale quantities.? Given the complexity of the materials and the level of program knowledge required for non-lethal vessel stopping, USU is the only source possessing the requisite expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering, production, and quality of service to accomplish all tasking. ? The Navy has previously contracted material research and development support from the Utah State University under contract FA8075-14-D-0014.? This contract is for the continued research and development support of USU to further refine and produce spider silk and hagfish slime filaments and yarn using transgenic silk worms as well as bacterial production and goat?s milk expression of spider silk and hagfish slime proteins.? For another contractor to develop the necessary knowledge, expertise and inherent technical data to perform this service at an acceptable material performance level would take several (4-5) years at a minimum.? This notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source action is not a request for competitive proposals.? A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.? All responsible sources may submit a response, which will be considered.? All responses should be directed to maximillian.a.moore.civ@us.navy.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis or by COB 4:00 P.M. CDT 15 June 2022.?

When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5. PACKAGING 5.1 Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking - Preservation, Packaging, Packing and Marking shall be in accordance with the Contract/Purchase Order Schedule and as specified below. MIL-STD 2073 PACKAGING APPLIES AS FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THE SCHEDULE 6.
