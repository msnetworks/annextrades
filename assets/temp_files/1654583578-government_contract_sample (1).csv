REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the VALVE,CHECK furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;80064 803-1385637; cage ;80064 803-1385637-062AF(MOD); . 3.1.1 ;(MOD) - A 1/8 inch diameter hole to be drilled in the Disc, PC 17 of Drawing 803-1385637, to provide priming flow to the standby service pump.; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

Due to the complexity and Federal security and regulatory requirements the prospective vendor must have experience working in a multi-tiered environment and support systems within other federally operated healthcare facilities and hospital experience is preferred. Experience within non-Federally operated hospitals will be considered but Federal Hospital experience will carry more weight. C. Relevant Past Performance Element 1. The Offeror shall identify and complete the past performance survey requirement for a minimum of two (2) and maximum of five (5) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three years from solicitation close date. Relevant is defined as any contract or subcontract valued at similar magnitude or greater.

Past performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractor?s past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort. The Contractor shall submit the past performance questionnaire surveys (Attachment 1) to the references. The references should submit those surveys directly back to the Government via email (dekovan.cook@ihs.gov) by the close date of this solicitation. If the Offeror submits surveys that have already been completed, the Government shall immediately discard and ignore them, and re-survey those references. Since the Contractor will submit the past performance questionnaire survey directly to their references for completion, it should be returned directly from the reference to the Government by the quote submission date. Element 2. Relevant Past Performance evaluation via Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). PPIRS records for the identified contract under element 1 will be assessed and other records within PPIRS may be considered. No submission is required for this element. PRICE QUOTE (Volume 2) Element 1. The price quote shall be a separate volume from your technical and past performance volume. The price quote is to be submitted as a Firm Fixed Price quote and may be in the Offeror?s preferred format. Excel worksheets shall have working cells and formulas, and be rounded to no more than 2 decimal places. It is critical for the Offeror to acknowledge that the Technical Drawings and Specifications Manual provided in the attachments J01b and J01c are the Government?s estimate and for informational purpose only. It is the Offeror?s responsibility to analyze, calculate and determine the final product within the required specifications in its Firm-Fixed-Price offer. In accordance with the FAR 16.202-1 - A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor?s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties. Therefore, it is highly encouraged for the offerors to attend the scheduled site visits and ask as many questions as possible to clarify the requirement and reduce any assumptions. No assumptions will be accepted under the RFQ and Offeror?s quote may be disqualified by the Government if the CO determines an Offeror?s proposed assumption brings too much of performance/cost risks to the government. Element 2. Offerors shall submit a price breakdown and/or crosswalk with its firm-fixed-price offer. The information shall allow the government evaluators to comprehend the Labor and Material the Offeror is proposing to accomplish the project. Furthermore, the price quote shall include any BOM that the Offeror has developed for the project. An overview summary of the BOM is required and the summary must identify any contractor proposed BOM areas that are notably differ from the government estimated product with a narrative for the difference(s). Offerors shall provide price per unit of items on the BOM exceeding $10,000. All other items may be rolled up into your quote. Redacted Versions of the labor-mix and BOM without pricing information are also required. 6 of 10 TRIBAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OFFICE (TERO): TERO Ordinances require that all employers who are engaged in operating a business on reservations give preference to qualified Indians in all aspects of employment, contracting and other business activities.

EVALUATION GENERAL The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses management approach, technical capabilities, installation schedule, personnel qualification, and organizational experience), past performance and price factors.

In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government. Offerors are advised that award will be made to that Offeror whose quote provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining technical and performance capability superiority rather 8 of 10 than lowest overall price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall price to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as quotes become more equal based on other factors. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of requirements of the RFQ.

Offerors should be aware that the Government shall perform a ?best value analysis? and the selection for award shall be made to the Offeror whose quote is most advantageous to the Government. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.
