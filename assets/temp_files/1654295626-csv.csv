When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5.

The current posture as it relates to COVID has led to a large decline in the number of cleared interpreters required. In 2020 we used 231.00 SCI hours, 150.00 Top Secret hours and 2,163.50 Secret hours. All labor hour are driven by requests for cleared services. 3. Can the State Department provide a historical data breakdown from the past year on: The total number of hours of services (for ASL Interpreting and CART services) a. The number of all-day on-call assignments (interpreters/writers scheduled 7 or more hours per day on the same days each week) ? We currently request services for 6 daily on-call interpreters (8 hours) and 1 oncall for 6 hours. b. The number of assignments that were 3 hours or less c. The number of assignments that were 7 hours or more d. The number of hours of evening/weekend work ? 2021 we had 0 Weekend hours. ? 2019 we had 2 Saturday (24.00) requests and 4 Sunday (23.50) requests e. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 5 business days? notice) f. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 1 business days? notice) ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2021 we had 294 requests totaling 742.50 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2020 we had 287 requests totaling 611.25 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2019 we had 360 requests totaling 513.75 hours g. How many requests were outside of the main location? ? 2019 we supported one employee daily for 8 hours OCONUS with a TS/SCI clearance ? 2019, 2021 and 2022 we also provide 8 hours daily interpreting on the West Coast at one of our locations. ? We provide interpreting services in New Orleans, New York and San Francisco with less than 8 hours per month. 4. In the RFI document, it states ?Interpret and/or transliterate continuously for not more than two (2) hours at a time without a break. In order to prevent repetitive motion injuries industry standard requires 2 interpreters for assignments requiring over 1.5 hours of continuous interpreting. Will the State Department confirm that a team will be provided when there will be 1.5 hours or more of continuous interpreting? ? Our ASL team is comprised of Certified Sign Language Interpreters who actively provide interpreting services for the Department. Each request is approached as not only fulfilling the assignment but also ensuring that the integrity of the message can be maintained while examining factors such as length of time, technicality, number of customers involved etc. The Department follows the 2-hour minimum as a rule with consideration given to other factors. 5. The RFI states there is a requirement for CART but does not specify whether the requirement is for onsite or remote CART. Will the State Department clarify whether it requires onsite or remote CART or both? ? The Government requires both. CART usage Is low (2019 - 19 requests totaling 114 hours). 6. There is a drastic difference between on-site CART writer and remote CART writer with on-site CART needing a 30-minute set-up time prior to the start of an assignment and each having very different minimum charges. Will the State Department recognize the difference when issuing their solicitation in the future? We suggest adding a CLIN to allow separate pricing for these services so that vendors can provide the most competitive pricing possible. ? Yes, we will consider this. ? All service providers are required to arrive 30 minutes prior to the assignment to provide enough time to get to the location and to be ready to begin at the designated time. In the case of interpreters, this time is not billed.

While the contract is administered by GTM/OAA/DRAD, the contractor will work independently with the employee requiring the accommodation.? The RASS shall operate autonomously demonstrating a high degree of professional autonomy and integrity in their work.? They shall employ a high level of critical thinking skills and techniques to ensure barrier free access.? While the RASS do not take ownership of the work product, the RASS may provide support to facilitate seamless and unencumbered accommodations to the employee. While consistency is the hallmark of an effective accommodation, there may be periods when services must transition to another RASS.? They shall maintain handover notes outlining processes used within the tailored accommodation to facilitate a smooth transition to the incoming RASS. ?Notes shall include, file locations, formatting conventions, any key point that will assist an incoming RASS in maintaining continuity of services. If the DoS employee requiring the accommodation does not need services, the RASS may be assigned to support administrative functions for the GTM/OAA Director, GTM/OAA Deputy Director and the GTM/OAA/DRAD and GTM/OAA/AD chiefs. When this occurs, these duties are secondary and may never take priority over their primary responsibilities.? POSITION 3 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION SUPPORT SPECIALIST II (RASS-II) (2) DOS employees requiring a RASS II accommodation have been identified by DRAD as employees who require a higher level of commitment and support.? Typically, employees who require this level of assistance work at senior executive levels.? This may include an increased need to adjust hours of work to match the customer and may include an increased need for travel beyond the standard workstation. Other aspects of the work environment requiring a heightened level of attention: Experience ? A RASS II must have previous experience providing accessibility for someone who is blind or who has low vision.? They must have prior experience providing sighted guide and have worked with accessible technologies such as Job Access with Speech (JAWS). Note Taking ? Ensuring notes are accurate, concise and that notes are captured electronically the same day for access by the employee. Time management ? Ensuring scheduling is handled in a manner that empowers the employee to effectively manage their time.? This includes ensuring the calendar is always updated, indicators of timing is conveyed to employee during meetings and/or relational to events, and discussions with employee to manage expectations on a daily/weekly basis. Initiative ? Logistics need to be driven by the DOS employee, but initiative must be taken by the RASS II to ensure preparations are completed to allow the employee seamless access to the physical and electronic environment of the work.? This includes prioritization of what needs to be made accessible for the meetings such as documents, bios, pictures and collecting information needed prior to meetings, during the meetings and after the meetings and ensuring it is accessible to the employee. Travel Logistics ? Coordinating travel requirements pre travel advising on aspects of accommodations and ensuring accessibility is coordinated pre, during and post travel. Assertiveness ? The RASS II will be providing access for employees at a senior level.? It is essential that the RASS II is assertive and able to drive the accommodation instead of relying on the DOS employee to always provide direction.? They must be able to provide this level of assertiveness including the employee so they are empowered to perform their work effectively.? POSITION 4 ? PERSONAL ASSISTANT SERVICES (PAS) PROVIDER (1) The Department may have the need for one (1) qualified full-time employee to provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) for eligible employees or applicants.? Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 791, and its implementing regulation , 29 CFR1614.203 requires DOS to provide PAS to eligible employees who, because of severe disabilities, require such assistance in order to be at work or participate in work-related travel.? PAS are services that help individuals with disabilities perform activities of daily living, including, such as, assistance with removing and putting on clothing, eating, and using the restroom.? Additionally, PAS could include providing travel assistance to an employee or retrieving work materials that are out of reach.? GTM/OAA/DRAD determines eligibility for PAS.? DOS employees with severe disabilities determined to be eligible for services are hereafter referred to as ?eligible employees?. The personal nature of the services and regulatory requirements, the preferences of GTM/OAA/DRAD and eligible employees must be taken into consideration.? The Contractor shall allow GTM/OAA/DRAD and/or eligible employees to meet/conference with Contract personnel referred for consideration and, if approved by GTM/OAA/DRAD, after selection/assignment to support and/or facilitate the delivery of care. PAS may be required to provide care to more than one eligible employee, depending on the eligible employee?s location, level of care, and schedule.? If more than one eligible employee is being supported and an eligible employee must travel on official business, whether local, domestic, or international, the Contractor must ensure services are provided for all assigned eligible employees.? The contractor must be proficient in identifying PAS providers worldwide to ensure the uninterrupted deliver of services. The PAS Provider: Shall preconference with the employee and the Program Office to identify specific employee needs, tasks to be performed and discuss accommodations. Notify GTM/OAA/DRAD whenever any significant changes to needs or tasks are identified.? All changes must be approved by the program office prior to implementation.

Informational Posting Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Enterprise Digitalization and Case Management Office Digitalization Technology Verticals The purpose of this special notice is to provide an update on the digitalization activities of the Enterprise Digitalization and Case Management Office (ED&CMO), which spearheads IRS efforts to empower taxpayers and IRS employees to rapidly resolve issues in a simplified digital environment. ?Specifically, it will: 1) provide a brief update on the three existing Technology Verticals, primarily to provide historical context for ED&CMO?s actions in this space; 2) outline initial tentative topic areas for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Technology Verticals; and, 3) provide context around considerations for any other new FY22 procurement needs. In FY21, ED&CMO issued three Technology Verticals using the Pilot IRS framework (on average, those procurement actions took less than 30 calendar days from solicitation to contract award). ?The three FY21 Technology Verticals focused on: 1) extracting machine readable data from low resolution and poor quality images and hard copy documents (summarized as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)); 2) digitalizing paper documents and transmitting the digital files back to the IRS via a digital channel (summarized as Scanning as a Service (SCaaS); and, 3) generate information which improves the taxpayer experience when a mobile device is directed at IRS images, forms, etc., based on publicly available information (summarized as Augmented Reality (AR)). ?As intended, all three Technology Verticals resulted in multiple awards with an initial period of 30 days to 6 months, followed by a targeted selection of a smaller number of industry partners for contract option exercise and continued funding. ?Each of the Technology Verticals has contributed significantly to the understanding and awareness of ED&CMO, and although industry partners in all three areas continue to be funded, additional investment in these areas will continue to be dependent on Return on Investment, the ability of the solutions to serve the needs of the IRS, and overarching prioritization decisions. In FY22, ED&CMO intends on issuing two to three additional Technology Verticals, again relying on the Pilot IRS framework. ?Currently, those Technology Verticals will focus on three topic areas: 1) the application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Robotic Process Automation (AI/ML/RPA) in human resources processes (i.e., using automation to accelerate manual processes); 2) process and technology solutions to improve high-manual touch processes that have limited visibility before they are completed; and, 3) cryptocurrency and digital assets. ?ED&CMO anticipates finalizing the topic areas by April 30th. ED&CMO may have other procurement needs in FY22, but it does have existing vehicles (which were completed in FY20) that it will leverage for the majority, if not all, of these needs. ?As the topic areas for the Technology Verticals are finalized, ED&CMO will issue additional special notices, Requests for Information, and will provide ample opportunity to engage with our industry partners.?? ?

The juvenile specialist will primarily respond to Pleasanton Unified School District sites and within the community as needed for mental health calls for those under 18 years of age. A mental health clinician specializing in providing treatment to children, teens and families will respond to these situations. Given the complexity of interacting with children and families in crisis, a specialist with experience in this area is requested. The second clinician will specialize in adult mental health and substance abuse. This clinician will collaborate with outside mental health services that oversee adult case management and with the homeless liaison officers which would allow the Alternative Response to Mental Health Unit (ARHM Unit) to better serve the housed or unhoused living in a chronic state of mental health crisis. The ARMH Unit will be the initial touchpoint for persons in crisis and will have the knowledge, skills, and ability to refer to other local mental health service providers for case management.."

Tabulations for these solicitations should be available on Ionwave within 48 hours of the opening. In some cases, they may be available earlier. We ask that you limit exposure by viewing tabulations electronically through IonWave, rather than attending at City Hall.

Responses or parts of a response whether hardcopy or electronic that cannot be viewed may deem your submittal as non-responsive. In addition, the City reserves the right to request clarification in such cases.
