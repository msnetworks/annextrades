Wylie Ambulatory Care Center (VAACC) 420 N. James Road, Columbus, OH 43219. 2237# 757-22-3-096-0376 Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount: The contractor to provide all labor and materials to remove and replace the existing Millipore Sigma RO Water System with new Millipore Sigma Pure Water System. Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: The current Millipore System is end of life. A new system is needed to replace current system. To avoid additional cost the new system needs configured for a direct replacement without any modification to the current electrical, plumbing, or structure. This will minimize the downtime. Also, the alarm system in SPS is already in place and won t require a modification. In addition, for an additional savings Millipore will provide a credit for turning in their current system. Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted: Market research was conducted included speaking with Millipore Sigma Project Manager. Additional Market Research was completed by search of VIP using NAICS 333999 which resulted in 110 Contractors, adding key words resulted in 32 Contractors, however we believe Millipore Sigma, or their Authorized Distributors are the only Contractors able to provide this requirement without any modification to our current electrical, plumbing or structures. The VA Rule of Two is Unattainable. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. ____________________________ ________________________ Gina P.

NOTICE TO OFFERORS: Please note that a BPA is not a contract. A BPA is a streamlined method for acquiring products or services on an as needed basis from qualified sources that are readily available and thus eliminate the need for repetitive costly re-procurements. Establishment of a BPA does not guarantee calls will be made. There is no minimum guaranteed quantity. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice. The Government may request a site visit with any offeror to establish acceptability. Awarded BPA holders undergo annual visits to ensure standards are met. Each BPA will have up to a three (3) year ordering period with a ceiling of up to $2,275,179.20, the BPA will expire after three (3) years or the $2,275,179.20 ceiling is reached, whichever comes first. BPA calls will have a purchase limit of $249,999.99 per call. The ceiling of each agreement can be increased or decreased at any time by the Contracting Officer (KO) via a bilateral modification to meet current and future requirements. Such instances can include pandemics, natural disasters, and any other reason the Government determines the need for increased or decreased lodging accommodations are needed. Funding is not assigned to the BPA. The Government will only be obligated to the extent of calls placed against an awarded BPA. BPA call requests will be sent to some or all BPA awardees to verify if capacity is available to provide meal drop offs to the desired area requested. Government will rotate vendors under their discretion and vendor availability. The call will then be placed based on which BPA vendor has the capacity to handle the call and is willing to accept the call. The individual meal rates shall not exceed the maximum allowable General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) per diem rates for meals, which can be found at https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates. The Government reserves the right to cancel this combined synopsis/solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this combined synopsis/solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs. In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(g) which is incorporated by reference, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and past performance and award a BPA without discussions with offerors. Please review FAR 52.212-1 in its entirety. Offerors must have a current registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov as of the date of award determination to be eligible for award. Offeror shall ensure all representations and certifications are current in SAM as a condition of award. EVALUATION CRITERIA: Basis of award is best value. BPA(s) will be awarded based on the best value to the government. The following evaluation factors will be utilized: EVALUATION FACTORS: Evaluation Factor 1- Past Performance: The PRARNG- P&C will determine acceptability based on either Contractor ?Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings, Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) or from other sources (if necessary). Recency of past performance is determined by work completed within the past three (3) years. If an offeror has no recent or relevant past performance, past performance will be treated as neutral, resulting in an acceptable rating. Past Performance will be rated as either, Acceptable or Unacceptable. Evaluation Factor 2?? Quotes: PRARNG- P&C will determine lowest price (*See Quotes Preparation Instruction on Attached Combined Synopsis*) PRICING:?Prices listed in the BPA are firm fixed price and shall not include tax, as Government?s procurements are tax exempt. The Government intends on sending a request for quote for each call/order where pricing and availability is verified.

All responses must be submitted to the Government point of contact at the email address shown below.
