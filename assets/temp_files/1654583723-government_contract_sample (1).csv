Only those firms who respond to this announcement by submitting the following information will be used in determining whether to set aside this requirement. Please do not respond to this notice unless you intend to respond to the solicitation.? A.)

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 10:00 AM Pacific Time on May 3, 2022.? Summary of Scope of Work:? The current Walla Walla Headquarter Building has been in use for about 27 years after the original Walla Walla Headquarters relocated to the new building in 1995. The firestopping measurements put in place during the original construction of the building are critical to the safety of personnel, as such measures keep fire and smoke out of certain designated areas. The FY21 inspection revealed several rooms in the HQ building have insufficient firestopping measures and can?t meet the 1-hour rating requirements. Ducts, piping, conduit, and wires are improperly sealed as they penetrate horizontally through walls and vertically through ceilings. Some penetrations allow smoke to pass through and in other cases can?t withstand fire for the necessary duration. The work to be performed as part of this requirement would include making the neccessary firestopping upgrades to get the building up to date.?"

These magnets will be used to bend and focus high energy and high intensity electron beams in the EIC rapid cycling electron synchrotron ring (RCS) and the EIC electron storage ring (ESR). Both TJNAF and BNL will be responsible for the final design, procurement, and quality assurance of different magnet families for the EIC project. EIC can refer to either lab with respect to the magnet procurements. BNL will be responsible for the final installation and commissioning of the magnets in the EIC complex. While it is anticipated installation and commissioning will primarily be a BNL responsibility, JLab and our satellite system supplier(s) will certainly have some involvement in those phases as well to ensure the proper installation and startup of the magnets. This combined pre-solicitation notice, sources sought request and request for information (RFI) communication is a critical first step in our path to success. Its intent is to bring our industry partners into the loop as early in the process as possible prior to release of any formal requests for proposal(s) (RFP) that we anticipate releasing in the next 12 to 24 months. As you will see from the questions we will be posing, we would like industry to have some input into the process with potential influence on the strategy, specifications, and supporting documentation as they get finalized prior to any RFP(s).

Those companies successfully appointed to the Qualification System will receive all future tender enquiries.

Applicants interested in participating in the procurement process must complete and return the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) which is appended to this notice

Please note the closing date on the PQQ cover sheet 2nd November 2020 is incorrect, IE can accept PQQ???s up to 15/10/2023 ref section 1.2 of the PQQ

The HPLC instrument will need to have a built in autosampler system. This pump system is flow rate agile and can accommodate flow rates and pressures typically used in traditional HPLC application while being able to accommodate the lower flow rates and higher pressure needed for UPLC applications. The pump will handle flow rates from 0.001 ml/minute up to 5 ml/minute. At 0.001 ml/minute (1ul/minute) the flow accuracy for this pump is 0.1%. This pump system will allow the University to do both semi-preparative work and high resolution, low sample consumption methods. The pump can use and mix on the fly up to four different solvents and includes two separate fluid flow paths plus a waste path. The mixing accuracy for the lowest flow rate is a mere +/- 0.5%. The pump system must also include a column heater/cooler system. This will create consistent conditions for each method and minimizes run-to-run errors based on ambient conditions. Second, we are looking for the system to include a Photodiode Array UV-vis detector. The PDA not only allows the user to monitor multiple wavelengths at once but also records the entire UV-vis spectrum during the course of the chromatographic run. Additionally we wish all suppliers to include a nitrogen generator. Typically, MS systems require ultra-pure nitrogen to function. The nitrogen generator can also be used to supply gas to other instruments as needed. Overview of the eRFQ ProcessThe objective of the eRFQ is to select one or more qualified suppliers to provide the goods and/or services outlined in this eRFQ to the State Entity. This eRFQ process will be conducted to gather and evaluate responses from supplier for potential award."

"Trades and Subcontracts: HVAC, Refrigeration, Mechanical Bids",UT,Minuteman III (MMIII) Brine Chiller Purge/Flush Process,Federal,,Department of Defense,13-05-2022,Department of Defense,https://sam.gov/opp/c3cad3042ef14ca0baf980cbd65ce7f5/view,MMIII_Brine_Chiller_,Purchasing,,703-695-7145,dan.scheer@us.af.mil,,"NOTICE:? This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes only. Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? Rather, the purpose of this RFI is to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.? A determination by the Government not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. BACKGROUND: The Air Force (AF) has need to modernize the HVAC Purge/Flush Process and Equipment used to maintain MMIII in addition to the transition to the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ??The AF would like to obtain information to understand if processes and equipment are available and obtainable. The purpose of this RFI is two-fold. The first purpose is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be a full and open competition and/or a total small business set-aside.? The Government is looking at several North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) codes; 238220 HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-condition) contractors or 423730 HVAC equipment merchant wholesales. ?If an alternate NAICS code is recommended, please provide the recommendation in the response.? The AF is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.? The AF requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable, and identify your business status to the identified NAICS code (see the Section labeled ?Responses? for response requirements).? Additionally, please provide any potential teaming arrangements.? Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The second purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about schedule, cost, and other aspects of this potential procurement from the perspectives of development and implementation. DESCRIPTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) maintains ICBM?s in the northern United States. In an effort to establish greater warfighter capabilities multiple systems are capable of initiating ICBM launches. The Brine Chiller Purge is used to ensure the HVAC equipment will be sufficient to sustain MMIII and through the transition to GBSD through acquisition (and modification as needed) of required equipment. The legacy/current process and equipment for evacuating and dehydrating, checking the refrigerant pressure, and reclaiming and servicing the LF and MAF Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-systems are using these available industry parts: Yellow Jacket (PN21012) oil changing pump SPX Robinair Vacuum Pump (PN 15600) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Reclaimer (PN 17800B) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Receiver Tank (PN 17121) The process, in conjunction with using the parts listed above, takes maintenance technicians an average 3-5 days to complete.? A bench checkout on the Brine Chiller is conducted post servicing the Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-system.? CAPABILITIES:? Field and/or Apprentice Technician level and/or skill set Basic HVAC Principle Training focus on ECS and EPA regulation List hazardous and/or flammable materials List of general, specialty, and/or sole source equipment and materials Vacuum operating level maximum must be below and hold below 500 Microns no less than 5-minutes; no minimum level purge or holding requirement Overall timeline for completing process must be less than 3-days with a bench check? process ideally less than but no more than 4 hours (i.e. 2-hours under low heat load and 2-hours under high heat load) Operating procedures and/or user?s manual ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED: Provide a schedule from contract award through qualification and implementation Provide an estimate cost range as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) from contract award through qualification and implementation. RESPONSES: Responsible and capable sources may identify their interest by providing a white paper capability statement (limited to 10 pages) with sufficient information to substantiate respondents have all of the capabilities listed in Capabilities and answering all questions. ?Please see the section for Eligibility Requirement. Government will consider responses to one or all of the purposes depending on company?s capability. ADDITIONAL NOTICES: Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? A determination by the AF not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the AF. ?The AF will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.? ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT: The distribution of the draft specification and top level drawings is limited to contractors with a DD 2345 certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service, Joint Certification Program (1-877-352-2255) and who have a legitimate business purpose. As such, WBS cannot be provided to a contractor without a certification. Contractors who would like to become certified can find the form and instructions at: https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx. Interested parties are advised that certification of a DD Form 2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form as soon as possible is highly recommended.
