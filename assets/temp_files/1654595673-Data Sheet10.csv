Readiness is dependent on having a reliable and resilient energy infrastructure.? ?Achieving energy readiness in Bridgeport is challenging for two primary reasons.? First, the installation is the last customer on the Southern California Edison (SCE) utility feed. Second, the base is located in an unforgiving, remote, and arduous area of the Sierra Mountains in California. Every year, the base experiences power outages due to extreme snowfall, sub-zero temperatures, forest fires, heat waves, power quality issues, and other planned and unplanned utility grid events.? The base regularly operates for minutes up to weeks, off a single generator with aged infrastructure and inadequate controls. This is a significant vulnerability. Bridgeport is addressing these issues with two (2) projects P-480 and P-481. The projects focus on enhancing the reliability and redundancy of the electrical distribution system and enhancing resiliency. The end state of this project is a reliable, resilient, efficient, and cybersecure microgrid that will provide the base the ability to operate critical installation services and mission essential functions off the grid for several weeks with N+1 redundancy. These projects are to be awarded together. The intent is to have a Design-Build contractor develop one design containing both projects and construct the projects with one timeline for maximum efficiency. Below are the two (2) projects. P-480 Project P-480 must provide a 750kW Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with a minimum of 500kWh storage capacity and must provide required documentation and fees for the interconnection agreement with SCE. The project must replace the generator switchgear and generator controls in Building 2003. The project enhances resiliency at the 480/277V and 208/120V distribution levels. Eight (8) exterior switchboards must be replaced. To provide power to ten (10) switchboards, equipment including an exterior disconnect will be provided to allow transfer from utility power to a mobile generator. This project extends the Industrial Control Systems fiber network at MWTC. Fiber optic cable must be provided, in order to extend the AMI network to include Building 2003 and Building 4046. The AMI network server must be replaced and be relocated to Building 4046, and a new AMI program must be installed to current versions. This project will disconnect the existing copper DDC building controllers and re-establish communication to Building 1036 via existing dark fiber in the AMI fiber optic cabling throughout the base. For buildings which are not connected to the AMI fiber optic cabling, fiber optic cable must be provided to connect these buildings into the network. Buildings which require a fiber optic cable connection include Building 1035,Building 1999, Building 2000, and Building 2002. All DDC building controllers must be networked to Building 1036 and Building 4046. Building controllers and all associated objects must also be integrated to and defined on a new FRCS server to be provided in Building 4046. New operator workstation must be provided in Building 1036. Operator workstation shall be integrated and network to the new Facility Related Control System (FRCS) server to be provided in building 4046. Server shall be capable of supporting a site of at least 150 buildings. P-481 The project must Provide Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to augment the BESS from P480. Provide an additional 3 MWh of energy. Expand grid-facing energy storage system, which will work in conjunction with distributed energy resources (DERs), to allow the continuous flow of clean power to the MWTC grid. The BESS must allow the MWTC to be entirely powered by renewable energy during most daylight hours, making MWTC a model of resilience in a cold weather environment. During a multi-day winter outage, the storage will balance load and generation between the PV and the new 550 kW generator. While grid connected, the storage will be used to manage peak demand and support the SCE grid by responding to frequency and voltage transients.? Furthermore, stabilizing the grid locally might reduce the likelihood of an outage. The system will disconnect if an unstable grid is detected. If both the 1 MW and 550 kW generator are down, the PV and BESS components (described below) can power the installation, although load would be reduced significantly by the EMIS system to provide power throughout the night. The project must provide a 550 kW generator to increase resilience of base-wide backup system. This generator will augment the renewable energy system, meet the complete power needs of the installation, and provide N+1 redundancy to the existing 1 MW generator. This 550 kW generator will primarily run during times of extended island mode, and in support of the DERs, to maximize renewable production and extend available fuel supply. This level of redundancy is crucial to ensure continuity of operations during sub-zero temperature events and during fires when SCE has grid outages. The project must provide 2 MW of solar photovoltaics. The PV systems must connect to the microgrid. The PV must work in conjunction with the BESS to maximize the use of renewable power. In addition, the configuration will allow the base to continue producing, consuming, and charging the BESS with PV-generated electricity, even when MWTC is disconnected from the SCE grid. The project must supply additional electrical infrastructure to accommodate the additional distributed sources throughout the installation. This includes providing conductors, coordinating with SCE, installing disconnects and other requirements to successfully interconnect the additional sources to the grid. These upgrades are required for the installation of the additional PV assets described above to connect to the grid and offset utility costs or extend duration while islanded. The project must provide microgrid control functions and equipment required to perform these functions. Advanced controls on all DERs must be provided to expand the microgrid and increase system telemetry throughout buildings to increase efficiency and control loads during grid-tied and islanded operations. The controls will provide capabilities including, but not limited to, the following: (a) ?Smart? controls capable of taking input from the upstream sensors and automatically engaging the necessary DERs to detect, signal and automatically engage the necessary controls and equipment to ensure a continuous flow of ?clean? electric power to the installation, preventing outages and power fluctuations that can be damaging to electrical and electronic equipment, thereby reducing maintenance and repair costs. (b) providing grid-interactive economic opportunities to produce savings by taking advantage of varying utility rates throughout the day and year. (c) Implement programmed operation modes to optimize base operations based on conditions such as maximum duration, mission-support or normal day-to-day operations. (d) Communications capabilities to promptly and automatically notify personnel if the control system changes system operations, such as when responding to an incoming power fluctuation and engaging installation DERs. The project is to provide and Energy Management Information System (EMIS). The energy management information system (EMIS) must integrate the DDC, AMI, and, microgrid monitoring and control in a single historian, with access to a single software suite for visualization, analytics, and fault detection. This will allow operators to view data in a customized way and be alerted to maintenance needs, energy savings opportunities, and understand interactions between systems that would be otherwise unknown. The project must provide a building to house all of the associated microgrid, building, AMI and any other related utility controls, control/monitoring stations, databases/servers and support personnel. This building is to provide central monitoring/control area for all facility related control systems and equipment including servers, communication nodes and operator interfaces. This project includes engineering calculations and studies as required by FC1-300-09N. However, the coordination, load flow and arc flash studies must determine the best scheme and protection of the entire microgrid for both grid-tied and islanded operations during the design. These studies inform the required electrical upgrades, generate required arc-flash labels, and provide documentation for SCE. This project must provide training, simulation, and documentation. This includes a complete package of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and emergency operating procedures (EOPs) and in-depth training on the system capabilities, operations, functions, etc. Electronic operation, maintenance, and sustainment instruction (eOMSI) manuals for the EMIS and microgrid system, detailing the operation, commissioning, and maintenance of the system must be proviced. The contractor will also provide a simulated environment for the system for training operators, testing upgrades and performing what-if scenarios. The contractors will prepare maintenance schemes, providing maintenance cost, energy cost, manpower and expected equipment reliability data for all developed maintenance schemes. MWTC facilities leadership will determine which scheme to implement, but all developed schemes will be detailed and delivered to MWTC facilities leadership. The manuals will detail system modes from fully automatic to manual, describe how to perform outage drills, and provide detailed information on efficiency when operating in a prescribed mode. A complete mirrored system, ""sandbox"" environment will be provided to assist with training and to ensure that system changes (such as patching) will not affect system operation.? These documents will help ensure the installation maintains the best possible technologically-advanced maintenance plan at the lowest possible cost while maintaining equipment and system reliability and energy conservation. Cybersecurity is critical to implementing this project. Certification and Accreditation is required for all FRCSs included in this project.? The control systems (including systems separate from an energy management control system) will be designed, acquired and executed in accordance with DoDI 8500.01, DoDI 8510.01, Department of Defense Risk Management Framework (RMF) per UFC 4-010-06, Cybersecurity of Facility-Related Control systems, and UFC 1-200-01, General Building Requirements Section 3-6.5, and other relevant FRCS cybersecurity requirements. All equipment installed (hardware and software) will be open protocol, have the ability to connect to existing and future systems, and will include the proper firewalls. Upon project completion, the MWTC will have an authority to operate (ATO), and a functional and cybersecure FRCSs."

The solicitation number is 70Z08822RESDV0001. The solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2022-04.? The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 237130 Power and Communication Line and Related Structures. The size standard is $39.5 million. The purpose of this contract solicitation is to solicit a Tower/Antenna Multiple-Award Construction Contract (TMACC). The TMACC contracts will meet a majority of the USCG tower and antenna construction, maintenance, rehabilitation, demolition, inspection, and repairs with a value below $3M within the 50 United States and its territories. Initial contracts will be competitively solicited and awarded nationally.? Task orders will range from a minimum task order value of $3,500 dollars to a maximum task order value of $3 million dollars. Orders will be solicited on a competitive basis among the TMACC firms unless an authorized exception applies. The contracts offer a streamlined approach to construction contracting and ongoing competition between qualified contractors. Awards will be restricted to small business set-aside firms. All qualified small business firms can compete. The U.S. Coast Guard intends to award up to seven (7) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Nationwide Tower/Antenna Multiple Award Construction Contracts (TMACCs). The terms and ordering procedures of each contract will be uniform among the IDIQ contracts and consistent with ordering procedures in FAR 16.505. Each of the IDIQ contracts will include a base year plus four one-year options (five-year total). Task order limits will range from $3,500 to a maximum task order value of $3 million. The minimum guarantee for each individual contract will be $1,000. The anticipated aggregate capacity for the seven new national TMACC contracts is $24.9 million dollars. Contract awardees will be eligible to compete for TMACC task orders at various USCG Districts in locations nationwide. A map of the Coast Guard Districts has been provided below. Ordering authority will be available to any United States Coast Guard component with appropriate warrant authority. However, task orders will primarily be awarded and administered by the Coast Guard?s Civil Engineering Units (CEUs).

As stated in Section M of this solicitation, the Government intends to award a maximum of seven contracts, but reserves the right to adjust the number of contract awards or make no award at all. The Government intends to make multiple awards of this tower multiple-award construction contracts for one base year with four one-year option periods.?

This is a PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272 and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Acquisition Instruction (UAI) 5236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources upon completion of the capabilities review. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Sacramento District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List (PSL) for levee improvement bank protection/bank stabilization construction, also known as the Erosion Contracts for the Sacramento and American Rivers?within the Sacramento Valley. The objective of the PSL process is to identify and select responding firms that demonstrate the capacity and capability to successfully support critical USACE bank protection/bank stabilization construction projects and thus establish a PSL. ?Identifying and selecting prequalified sources will be based solely on the responding firm?s ability to meet the specific criteria that assess the firm?s bonding capability, capability to concurrently complete large construction projects, previous experience completing a large bank protection/bank stabilization construction project, and past performance. The selection process will be objective in that responding firms either meet or fail to meet the criteria. Failure to meet any one of the criteria may result in non-selection. The criteria were designed to ensure selection of clearly qualified contractors with experience and capability relevant to the anticipated requirements, provide competition, and minimize subjectivity in the Government?s assessment. The PSL will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. The PSL will be reviewed annually to ensure a legitimate need exists. Presently, the Government anticipates at least eight contract actions over the next four years. As such, it is likely that a legitimate need will continue for the next 6 years or 72 months. The PSL will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone ?C? type construction contracts where the high-end of any single contract is not expected to exceed $100M at this time. This, however, does not preclude the Government from soliciting and awarding a contract in excess of this amount if determined to be in the Government?s best interest. After the PSL is established, the Government intends to proceed by issuing solicitations using FAR Part 14 procedures (i.e., Invitation for Bid (IFB)). However, the Government reserves the right to issue solicitations using FAR 15 (i.e., Contracting by Negotiation (i.e., Best Value either Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable or Tradeoff)) when determined to be in the Government?s best interest. The magnitude of construction for the anticipated 8 contracts are as follows: American River Contract 1 ? Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 American River Contract 2 - Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 American River Contract 3 - Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 American River Contract 4 ? Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 Sacramento River Contract 1 -Between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 Sacramento River Contract 2 ? Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 Sacramento River Contract 3 ? Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000 Sacramento River Contract 4 ? Between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000 The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Construction, which has a small business size standard of $39.5M. Bonding Requirements: Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the PSL. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the successful bidder or offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation. To be considered qualified for the PSL, firms must meet the following minimum requirements: 1. The Contractor must have completed construction of one or more water resources projects, preferably Earthwork, in the last ten years, which contain the following work:?? ?a) Placement of rocks in-water ?- minimum 30,000 Tons ?b)?Excavation/Placement of soil fill on riverbanks - 100,000 cubic yard ?c)?Sediment control during in water work (excavation or rock placement) with the use of turbidity curtains, coffer dams or similar structure. 2. The Contractor must have completed construction of one or more water resources projects, preferably Biotechnical Bank Protection, in the last ten years, which contain the following work:?? Biotechnical bank protection involving erosion blanket installation, live cuttings, seeding and woody material with a minimum footprint of one acre. 3. Barge Contractors (for Sac River projects only) ? The Contractor must have completed two or more bank protection projects from the water side, in the last ten years, utilizing water-based equipment such as barges, scows, work and/or tugboats. 4.?Single?bonding capability of at least $30M and aggregate bonding capability of at least $200M. 5. Past Performance information that demonstrates satisfactory or above ratings for the projects used to demonstrate previous experience. If a formal assessment from Contractor Perforamcne Assessment Reporting System (CPARS)?is not available, a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) may be submitted.?A PPQ will be attached to this announcement. 6.?Certification/statement that all responses to the Prequalification of Sources criteria are accurate and complete by a principal of the firm. Project Experience Supporting Data: Example experience provided must include documentation such as contract document excerpts or as-builts for each project submitted which demonstrates experience in the above requested information. Additionally, for #3 a list of equipment currently in your fleet must be provided. Each example project must include a point of contact that may be reached if needed to verify the data. There is no page limitation, however, please flag or mark the pages to assist in verification of the requested data. Project Experience Submission:? Prequalification will be based on the experience submitted and approved.? Therefore, contractors may be qualified for the experience? listed in #1-3 above or in any combination thereof.? Annual PSL: The PSL will be established annually and be available for the project or projects listed to be solicited that calendar year. For instance, American River Contract 1 and Sacramento River Contract 1 both have current solicitation dates in calendar year 2021, therefore the first PSL will cover calendar 2021 and will be available for these two projects. In calendar year 2022, a new PSL will be set up to accommodate the projects solicited in that calendar year.? Annual PSL?s will allow contractors to be removed from the list if they are no longer interested and allow new contractors to be added to the list. This will be done by requesting and evaluating capabilities in a manner consistent with the calendar year 2021 PSL procedures. In the event contractor A was on the calendar year 2021 list and wanted to be included in the calendar 2022 list, a new submission would be required for the PDT?s review. If the submission has updated project information, it must be highlighted for ease of Government review. All new contractors wishing to be included on the new annual PSL, will be required to follow the strict submission requirements of the original PSL notice. All PSL notices will be posted to beta.SAM.gov. Once the PSL is established, a notice will be posted to beta.SAM.gov and shall identify by name, the contractors who are added to the list. Solicitation Process: 1.? The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List an email notification of its intent to advertise a requirement. The purpose of this notice is twofold. In addition to signaling the Government?s intent to advertise a requirement, this notice will also be used for determining prime contractor interest, to determine if the requirement should be set-aside for small business.? The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in being the prime contractor on the project. A separate Pre-solicitation Notice will be posted to beta.SAM.gov announcing the upcoming solicitation for the projects.? This notice will serve as a way of notifying potential sub-contractors of a new opportunity.? 2.? The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. In addition to indicating an interest in the project, small businesses on the Prequalified Sources List must also provide proof of sufficient bonding capacity. If the solicitation is issued as a small business set-aside (see para. 3 below), then proof of bonding capacity will have been used to demonstrate that the small business concern can responsibly compete. 3.? After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider whether the ?rule of two? is met per FAR 19.502-2(b) to determine if the project must be set aside for the small businesses on the list. If the ?rule of two? is met, then an IFB solicitation will be issued and if proceeding as a small business set-aside, only prequalified small businesses would be eligible for a contract award. 4.? The date of bid opening will be at least 30 days after issuance of an IFB. 5.? The bid results will be made available to all bidders via beta.SAM.gov. 6.? Upon identification of the apparent-low bid, the bid will be reviewed for conformity to the solicitation requirements (i.e., responsiveness) and contractor responsibility must be considered. 7.? After an affirmative determination of contractor responsibility is made per FAR 9.104. The Government will proceed with contract award. Requests for Information: Interested parties shall submit questions concerning this announcement via Bidder Inquiry in ProjNet at www.projnet.org/projnet. 1.?

You may download the RFP from the Internet by accessing the County’s website at https://camisvr.co.la.ca.us/lacobids/, selecting “Open Solicitations,” and then searching by the solicitation title of Special Tax Consulting Services. You may also download the RFP by accessing the TTC’s website https://ttc.lacounty.gov/contract-opportunities/. Potential Proposers are responsible for downloading and reviewing the entire RFP. The RFP contains the service requirements, proposal content and format requirements, a description of the proposal selection process, and a sample contract. Potential Proposers that meet the minimum requirements identified in Paragraph 3.0, Proposer’s Minimum Mandatory Qualifications, are invited to submit a proposal to provide the services described in Appendix A, Statement of Work. Potential Proposers should carefully review the RFP and ensure their proposal complies with all RFP requirements. Pursuant to Subparagraph 7.8.10, Proposers must list all of their exceptions in their proposal submission. Proposers may not take exception to the Standard Terms and Conditions in their entirety and replace the County’s Standard Terms and Conditions with the Proposer’s. The TTC will consider such a proposal to be non responsive. The TTC will recommend approval of the contract to the most responsive and responsible Proposer. In general, the greater the number of exceptions to the terms and conditions the Proposer lists, and the more substantive the exceptions are, the less responsive the proposal will be deemed. Thus, a Proposer that lists a large number of exceptions in quantity or quality will be scored accordingly. This practice reflects the fact that a Proposer that is able to accept the Standard Terms and Conditions as is, without any exception, is more responsive to the RFP than a Proposer that takes a number of exceptions to the Standard Terms and Conditions. During the negotiations process, the TTC limits the exceptions that can be negotiated to the exceptions listed in the proposal itself. The TTC would compromise the integrity of the RFP process if it were to negotiate an exception that the Proposer did not list in its proposal. If the Proposer had listed the exception in the proposal, the Proposer’s score would likely have been less than originally calculated, thereby having a potential impact to the ranking of all proposals. Proposals must be prepared in accordance with Paragraph 7.0, Proposal Submission Requirements. Proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Friday, June 17, 2022, and shall be delivered in accordance with Subparagraph 7.11 to: contracts@ttc.lacounty.gov.

However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall price to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as quotes become more equal based on other factors. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ.

Effingham County Judicial Complex currently has two Superior Courtrooms located on the 3rd Floor, one State Courtroom, and one Magistrate Courtroom located on the 2nd Floor, along with a Grand Jury room and Community room located on the 1st Floor. The Community room will be used as an overflow room for the courtrooms. The audio / video systems in both Superior courtrooms and the State courtroom are very similar to each other and are described in Current Systems below. The magistrate courtroom currently only has an audio system and a TV mounted on the wall with an HDMI input. The audio / video systems in the Grand Jury room and Community room are very similar to each other and are described in Current Systems below. All rooms A/V systems currently are independent of each other and have no interconnect features. The Effingham County Judicial Complex A/V systems have been in service for over ten years and are in need of replacement with upgrades. In addition, there is a need for streaming technology related to recent concerns over social distancing while still meeting mandates for public access to court proceedings. Effingham County is looking to replace and upgrade the A/V systems in all four Courtrooms and the Community / Overflow Room. (The A/V system in the Grand Jury Room is not part of this RFP but will be upgraded at a future time.) The new systems will need to have similar features and requirements as the current systems plus the ability to selectably interconnect to the Community / Overflow room for live viewing of court proceedings. Each system will need to be able to independently stream audio and video live to either YouTube or Vimeo along with the ability to web conference court proceedings using Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Web-EX for remote participation.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District is issuing the sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support the requirement for the supply of two (2) Deployable Oxygen Concentration Systems.? The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement.? The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 333912 ? Air and Gas Compressor Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,000 employees. ?The Product Service Code is 4310 ? Compressors and Vacuum Pumps. Statement of Work Oxygen (O2) Generation Systems: a. Provide modular pressure/vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems of capacities as identified below. Units shall come with stand-alone controls, piping, conduit, blowers, vacuum pumps, compressors or boosters, tanks gauges, sensors and mass flow meters. Controls shall accept input and provide output per below. These new modular pressure/vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems would tie into existing modular vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems. b. Oxygen is supplied to the system with on-site oxygen generators. These generators move filtered air through an adsorption bed resin or molecular sieve that removes nitrogen, leaving concentrated gaseous oxygen and the inert gas argon. Movement through the bed is at a low pressure with a vacuum cycle used to regenerate the beds by removing adsorbed nitrogen. The oxygen content supplied from the beds is monitored and the beds are pulsed to regenerate the resin. c. The oxygen gas coming from the generators will be between 90% and 95% oxygen content during normal operation with sufficient pressure to be injected into the pressurized Speece cones. The only oxygen storage provided is in buffer tanks to equalize pressure as the generators cycle through regeneration. The existing system has one oxygen buffer tank per operating generator. d. The oxygen generator shall have an integrated PLC and communicate with the main Dissolved Oxygen Injection System PLC via ethernet using MODBUS/TCPIP architecture, or natively speak to Allen Bradley COMPAC Logix 5000 via ethernet without conversion software.? PLC communication capabilities shall allow for supervisory control and monitoring of all data points and alarms monitored by the local PLC.?

Greenhouse gas emissions caused by the decomposition of organic material in landfills contribute to global climate change. Reducing the amount of organic material sent to landfills is part of the Assembly Bill (AB) 32 (California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006) Scoping Plan, is fundamental to Air Resources Board’s (ARB)’s Short-Lived Climate Pollutant (SLCP) Reduction Strategy and is one of California’s strategies for reaching the statewide 75 percent recycling goal.

Further, Boeing shall (1) utilize the DFARS 252.215-7009, Proposal Adequacy Checklist (PAC) (attached to this RFP letter), in pre-submission proposal quality reviews, and (2) furnish the completed checklist as part of its proposal submission. The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with Boeing.? The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the Contracting Officer (CO) has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. If Boeing is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, Boeing shall contact the Contracting Officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b). Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the Contracting Officer?s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: ? X? ?Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ? X? ?Calendar Year (CY) The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January ? December). If the proposal includes more than one CLIN/subCLIN, recurring/non-recurring costs shall be identified for each CLIN/subCLIN. When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet). When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format. Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. ?Boeing shall provide with its proposal historical Actual Costs Incurred (ACI) data for any similar efforts within the past 3 years. The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; b. contract type; c. contract quantity; d. contract price; and e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)). Note that per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B), modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in FAR 2.101, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial item definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-4) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award. ii. For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2). Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8).

The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.?

The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with Boeing.? The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the Contracting Officer (CO) has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. If Boeing is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, Boeing shall contact the Contracting Officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b).

If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this new Electrochemical Separation System. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. ? Overview:??? ????The recovery of critical materials from Li-ion batteries will allow a comprehensive and full recovery of value from mobile electronic devices and other battery powered systems including electric vehicles. Current industrial hydrometallurgical/pyrometallurgical battery recycling processes focus on the recovery of the most valuable metal (cobalt) and fail to recover lithium. This technology fits within the framework of a hydrometallurgical to effectively concentrate and purify Li from leachate solutions. Description:?? ?INL researchers are developing a process with low chemical consumption that allows an economic recovery of lithium along with the other value metals present in the batteries. This process includes an electrochemical separation step based on the use of a selective Li cation exchange membrane and a re-generable carbon source for the production of high purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). After dissolution of metals from the cathode of Li-ion batteries, the metal-bearing solution is transferred to the anode side of an electrochemical reactor separated with a monovalent cation exchange membrane. Lithium ions are transported across the membrane where they react with bicarbonate ions to form a pure lithium carbonate product. Benefits:??? ?????? Process enables economic recovery of Li along with the other valuable metals present in batteries. End product is pure lithium carbonate. Low operational costs ? Carbon Dioxide is only chemical consumed. Applications:?? Lithium-Ion battery recyclers and producers Enables isolation, purification, and recovery of: Magnesium, lanthanides, and other valuable metals with low solubility carbonates and bicarbonates. Development Status:? TRL 3. This is an early-stage technology in need of further development. ? IP Status: ??????? Patent Application No. 63/126,134, ?Methods of Recovering Lithium from a Lithium-Containing Material, and Related Systems,? filed December 16, 2020. ?BEA Docket No. BA-1012. INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities Please visit Technology Deployment?s website at https://inl.gov/inl-initiatives/technology-deployment for more information on working with INL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.

The 60mm M769, 81mm M879A1 and 120mm M931 FRPC consist of a hollow shell body with no energetic fill, and except for the color, looks identical to the High Explosive (HE) Cartridges.? The FRPCs utilize a center vent tube to simulate the weight of the HE fill and allow the fuze signature to be vented through a series of holes in the aft shell body.? The cartridge bodies accept the M775 Practice Fuze for the 60mm FRPC, the M751 Practice Fuze for the 81mm FRPC, and M781 Practice Fuze for 120mm M931 FRPC; which contain a spotting charge that ignites upon ground impact. The practice fuze produces a flash/bang/smoke signature that provides audio and visual feedback to forward observers. The plastic ogive simulates the contour and the four function settings of the M734A1 multi-option fuze used on the service mortars. The FRPCs currently use four increments as the propelling charge system is initiated by the ignition cartridge.

NTESS operates Sandia National Laboratories as a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and supports numerous federal, state, and local government agencies, companies, and organizations. As a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), NTESS may perform work for/with industry and/or academia. Any collaboration must allow FFRDC participation and meet the requirements of NTESS?s management and operating contract with DOE/NNSA.? NTESS may also license technologies in the form of patents, and copyrighted material (including software). Opportunity Description: NTESS is available to collaborate with non-federal entities (NFEs) including Business, Industry and Non-Profits, Universities, Government Agencies, and other National Labs to leverage a broad spectrum of talent and capabilities. A CRADA Participant benefits from Sandia?s programs and capabilities to potentially improve products/technologies for increased commercialization opportunities, furthers understanding of fundamental science in academia, and/or provides cutting-edge capabilities to help ensure our nation?s security. NTESS and DOE benefit from collaborative research supporting DOE missions and program objectives. What distinguishes a CRADA from other technology transfer mechanisms is the collaborative nature of the work; through a CRADA a Participant and NTESS will work together as collaborators. What NTESS Brings to the Collaboration: When executing a CRADA, NTESS allows Participants to access NTESS?s unique technologies, processes, capabilities, and technical knowledge, and protect commercially valuable information developed jointly under a CRADA. Collaborating with NTESS can result in improved products and technologies, research collaborations that explore niche areas, local economic development, and industry innovation.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is directed to ensure that the best possible medical supplies are procured timely and in accordance with proper regulations with vendors that are licensed and monitored according to Local, State, and Federal Regulations. Under the Atomic Energy Act, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for regulating uses of radioactive material including radio pharmaceuticals. The NRC requires all nuclear medicine facilities to be licensed. The license assures that the facility has a radiation protection program to protect both the patients and the staff.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to gauge the interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Construction Community, to include Small Businesses, as the Government must ensure there is adequate competition amongst the potential pool of responsible contractors. The project includes constructing three (3) gated water control structures along the L-67A levee, degradation of 15 existing spoil piles along L-67A canal, and plugging and partial backfill of an existing Agricultural Ditch. The project is anticipated for a potential fiscal year (FY) 2023 award. There is no solicitation at this time. ?This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The Jacksonville Districts anticipates the issuance of a Invitation for Bid (IFB). No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought or any follow-up information requested. Project Description: The work will be performed in a rural area of Dade County, Florida. The entrance to the project site is on the north side of US-41 (Tamiami Trial) and approximately 12 miles west of the intersection with US-27. The Scope of Work for this project includes the following three (3) items, (A) Install the proposed L-67A levee structures; S-631, S-632, and S-633 detailed as new gated flood control culverts, with 5.5-ft. x 5.5-ft. manual vertical slide gates, two (2) sets of stop logs, each with total design capacity of 500 cubic feet per second (cfs) to convey water from WCA 3A to WCA 3B; (B) Degrade 15 existing spoil piles located along the west side of the L-67A canal and move the material onto the project construction site; and (C) Construct earthen plugs within the existing east-west agricultural ditch, degrade existing spoil piles along the north side of the ditch, and partially backfill portions of the ditch. Specific Project Challenges: The work will be performed in a rural area of Dade County, Florida with limited access along a narrow existing levee embankment. The work is along the existing L-67A levee and within the surrounding Everglades Swamp lands. The lands outside the footprint of the levee are prone to flooding at all times of the year and the ground conditions are very soft and wet during all times of the year. Some of the work is located in or along existing canals which will require barges for access. The work will also require processing of on-site materials to produce embankment fill materials meeting the project specifications. It is anticipated that the work within and along the agricultural ditch will require the use of amphibious equipment and the use of hydraulic pump operations to move materials for the proposed ditch plugs. The contractor must be able to provide as-builts of the finished work acceptable to the Government. The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. The estimated period of performance for the base contract is 1,127 calendar days from receipt of the date of Notice to Proceed. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. ?The Small Business Size Standard for this project is $39.5 million.

Specific Project Challenges: The work will be performed in a rural area of Dade County, Florida with limited access along a narrow existing levee embankment. The work is along the existing L-67A levee and within the surrounding Everglades Swamp lands. The lands outside the footprint of the levee are prone to flooding at all times of the year and the ground conditions are very soft and wet during all times of the year. Some of the work is located in or along existing canals which will require barges for access. The work will also require processing of on-site materials to produce embankment fill materials meeting the project specifications. It is anticipated that the work within and along the agricultural ditch will require the use of amphibious equipment and the use of hydraulic pump operations to move materials for the proposed ditch plugs. The contractor must be able to provide as-builts of the finished work acceptable to the Government. The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. The estimated period of performance for the base contract is 1,127 calendar days from receipt of the date of Notice to Proceed.

Cartridge/filter covers/filter holders must be able to be wiped clean. Low profile cartridges Cartridges shall have a low profile to allow for increased visibility for the wearer. Filtered or no Exhalation Channel/valve The direction of the exhalation channel/valve has an impact on both worker and patient safety, as it could direct airflow towards an unprotected individual. In a pandemic situation, this could increase the rate of hospital-associated transmission. The exhalation valve directs exhaled breath and moisture downward to reduce face shield fogging. Comfort and Tolerability Mandatory Criteria Comment 1.

Description of Work The VHA Office of Integrity and Compliance (OIC) is seeking a contractor to conduct coding and documentation audits of VHA inpatient and outpatient encounters, coded by coders or providers, and claims billed to the VA through the VA Community Care Program. Audits of documentation and coded data will be performed on any of the VHA required coding activities (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, surgery). These audits will address accuracy of cod ed data, health record documentation issues, and include recommended remediation of specific documentation deficiencies, correction of erroneous codes, process improvement and identify educational needs. There will be approximately 34,000 cases to be audited per year and all necessary records will be made available to the contractor in electronic format. Possible audits will include, but shall not be limited to, audits related to Inpatient hospitalizations, ambulatory surgery, diagnostic tests (endoscopy, bronchoscopy, cardiac catheterization, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, pulmonary function, radiology, laboratory, etc.), primary care, mental health, medicine sub-specialty, surgery, observation, neurology, and Non-Veterans Affairs community care records, prosthetics, and DME services. Audits will include review of codes as well as the medical record documentation to validate the specific reason for the encounter and the services performed. Upon completion of each audit, the contractor will prepare a final audit report in the English language detailing all necessary and relevant information pertaining to the scope and objectives provided; the methodology; findings and recommendations of the auditor and other contract personnel. Each report will include, at a minimum, analysis of the accuracy of all coders (and possibly non-coder) supported codes within the claims, use of all modifiers, specificity of codes, deficiencies in documentation, adequacy of diagnosis for medical necessity, potential process improvements, or educational opportunities. Report results, analysis, opinions, observations, etc., should be based upon the scope of the audit as discussed with OIC. Audits do not require strict adherence to Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS). Audits should be performed in a structured manner incorporating elements of GAGAS to provide a high level of professionalism, independence and objectivity to the assessment allowing for oversight and improvement of areas reviewed. Technical Requirements Contractor must possess the necessary licenses, certifications.
