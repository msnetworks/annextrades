The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set-asides and sole source contracts. (2) Service-disabled Veteran means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). (b) General. (1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code. (c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service disabled veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award. (d) Agreement. Agreement. When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

This is not a formal Request for Quote (RFQ) or proposal (RFP).? Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.? United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has the need to increase the ceiling value of our current Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, H92401-18-D-0006, for Tactical Radio Application eXtension (TRAX) support with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434. TRAX capabilities are an integral part of the Digitally Aided Close Air Support Gateway SOF (DACAS-G-S) system fielded across the USSOCOM communications spectrum.? This contract supports maintenance, integration, training, aircraft demonstrations, exercise support for fielded systems, and Field Service Representative (FSR) support.? Moreover, this support includes software assurance for existing Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) on TRAX v2.0, TRAX Application Program Interface (API), Android TRAX (ATRAX), TRAX Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) Plug-in, and future TRAX software improvements/upgrades and the TRAX software meets Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certification requirements.? USSOCOM has procured enterprise licensing from SNC allowing proliferation of the capability throughout USSOCOM.? The above contract is currently set to expire on 23 August 2023 and, due to the higher than anticipated proliferation of the TRAX capability throughout the USSOCOM Special Operation community, the current contract ceiling value is not adequate to ensure continued support. In the last two ordering years, there has been a growth rate of 72% in obligation under the contract, with $16.4M being obligated last ordering year.? Due to fluidity of the requirements and changes in operational demands, it is estimated that the Special Operations community will require a similar obligation rate this year as last year, at $13.6M, and that this rate will increase again over the next ordering year to meet mission needs.? Therefore, it is necessary to increase the current contract ceiling by $16.7M. The modification will be executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one source is capable of satisfying the agency's requirements. ?This determination is based on the fact that SNC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole developer of TRAX/ATRAX software and given the fact that the Government did not purchase unlimited rights, no other company can provide the appropriate software updates/upgrades and level of support to sustain existing TRAX/ATRAX software systems. Per FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit additional capability statements that will be considered by the agency. Any party responding to this notice shall send clear, factual documentation demonstrating their ability to execute this requirement. NOTE: Given that this contract is not set to expire until late FY23, SOCOM currently has no plans to purchase an alternate capability at this time, but rather to continue to sustain TRAX/ATRAX. Therefore, capability statements must demonstrate the ability to either a. provide this sustainment in lieu of SNC, or b. provide an alternate capability that not only meets all the key capabilities of the SNC TRAX/ATRAX software and is Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified, but also offers increased capabilities that outweigh the substantial duplication of cost to the Government and significant delays in fulfilling our mission requirements that would be associated with introducing this new capability at this time. All replies must be provided to the Government no later than Tuesday, June 6th 2022, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. ?All inquiries and responses concerning this action shall be sent in writing via email to both: jennifer.s.pruente.civ@socom.mil and charlotte.k.montoya.civ@socom.mil.

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize MIL-I-45208 if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. 6.2 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings. There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T.

Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5.

Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARKED WITH THE NOMENCLATURE ""RMS COMPUTER"". DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=EOC Submit at the time of material delivery a Certificate of Compliance per DI-MISC-81356 to NAVSUP-WSS code N9433. A separate Certificate of Compliance shall be prepared and submitted for each unique combination of Contract/Purchase Order Number, National Stock Number and Item Nomenclature specified in the schedule of Supply/Services.

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The VALVE,LINEAR,DIRECT repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;78062 20711-002; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-130, REV N, 16 NOV 2012; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 4.4 Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 5.

The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.

Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.5 First Article Approval (Government Testing) - First Article Test (FAT) and approval is required. 3.6 Serialization - The supplier shall mark a serial number on each TRUCK,HAND in accordance with ;Obtain serial number from: Commander Naval Undersea Warfare Center Public Affairs Office 176 Howell St. Newport, RI, 02841-1708 Send request to NUWC_NPT_SerialNumbers@navy.mil Report unused serial numbers to NUWC_NPT_SerialNumbers@navy.mil Transfer of unused serial numbers to other contracts is prohibited unless authorized by the NAVUNSEAWARCENDIV.

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.

If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Inspection System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Governmnet. The inspection system requirements shall be in accordance with MIL-I-45208. 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. 6.2 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings. There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARKED WITH THE NOMENCLATURE AS CITED ON IRPOD.

F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. 6.3 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. MARK THE PACKAGING LABEL WITH THE NOMENCLATURE ""BURET STOPCOCK"". DATE OF FIRST SUBMISSION=EOC Submit at the time of material delivery a Certificate of Compliance per DI-MISC-81356 to NAVSUP-WSS code N9433. A separate Certificate of Compliance shall be prepared and submitted for each unique combination of Contract/Purchase Order Number, National Stock Number and Item Nomenclature specified in the schedule of Supply/Services.

Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings.

The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D.

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. 6.2 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection. The Government quality assurance representative shall be listed on the distribution in Block 14 and requested to provide comments via the quality assurance letter of inspection. Use of the symbol LT is not authorized for data comprising final delivery of Technical Data Package of for Technical Manuals. (LT may, however, be used for delivery of preliminary TDP's or TM's). (7) As specified in Block 8 of the DD Form 1423. (8) No inspection or acceptance required. No DD Form 250 or letter of transmittal required. Use of the symbol NO is not authorized for data comprising Technical Data Packages or for Technical Manuals. (9) Inspection and acceptance requirements specified elsewhere in the contract. Block 8: Is the approval code - Items of critical data requiring specific advanced written approval prior to distribution of the final data item will be identified by placing an ""A"" in this field. This data item requires submission of a preliminary draft prior to publication of a final document. When a preliminary draft is required, Block 16 of the DD Form 1423 will show length of time required for Government approval/disapproval and subsequent turn-around time for the contractor to resubmit the data after Government approval/disapproval has been issued. Block 16 will also indicate the extent of the approval requirements, e.g., approval of technical content and/or format. Block 9: Is the distribution statement code which explains how the Government can circulate the deliverable item. The definition of codes A, B, C, D, E, or F is as follows: A. Distribution of the item is unrestricted. B. Distribution of the item is limited to agencies only. C. Distribution of the item is limited to contractors with a cage code and have a DD Form 2345 on file with the DLA Logistics Information Services (DLIS) Battle Creek, Mich. or Government activities. D. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD activities and DOD contractors only. E. Distribution of the item is limited to DOD components only. F. Distribution of the item is restricted from Foreign Nations and Foreign Nationals. Block 10: Is the frequency which the deliverable item is expected to be delivered to the Government. The abbreviations and their meaning. ANNLY Annually ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required BI-MO Every two months BI-WE Every two weeks DAILY Daily DFDEL Deferred Delivery MTHLY Monthly ONE/R One time with revisions QRTLY Quarterly SEMIA Every six months WEKLY Weekly XTIME Number of times to be submitted (1time, 2times...9times) Use of these codes requires further explanation in Block 16 to provide the contractor with guidance necessary to accurately price the deliverable data item. Other abbreviations not appearing on the above list may on occasion be used in Block 10 of the DD Form 1423. When other abbreviations are used they will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 11: Is the last calendar date, expressed in year/month/day format, the deliverable item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423 for an item with a Block 10 entry indication a single delivery. If the item is to be submitted multiple times, the number stated is the number of calendar days after the frequency cited in Block 10 the item is to be received by the requiring office cited in Block 6 of the DD Form 1423. On occasion the deliverable item will be required to be submitted prior to the end of the frequency cited in Block 6. In that event the requirement will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 12: Is the date of first submission of the deliverable item to the requiring office (Block 4) expressed in year/month/day format. The abbreviations and their meaning are as follows: ASGEN As generated ASREQ As required DAC Days after contract date DFDEL Deferred Delivery EOC End of contract EOM End of month EOQ End of quarter Specific instructions for these requirements will be provided in Block 16. If the deliverable item is constrained by a specific event or milestone the constraint will be fully explained in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. ""As generated"", ""As required"", and ""Deferred Delivery"" will always be fully explained in Block 16. Block 13: Is the date of subsequent submission of the deliverable item, after the initial submission. Subsequent submission is only used to indicate the specific time period. The data is required when Block 10 of the DD Form 1423 indicates multiple delivery is required. This does not apply to resubmission of a deliverable item that has been reviewed by the requiring office and determined to be only conditionally acceptable or unacceptable. Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified. That specific information will be located in Block 16 of the DD Form 1423. Block 14b: Is the number of copies of draft and or final copies to be submitted. When final ""Repro"" copies are to be submitted Block 16 will clarify the type of Repro copies required. (e.g., vellum, negative, etc.) Block 15: Is the total of each type of copies to be submitted as required by Block 14. Block 16: Is the block used to provide additional or clarifying information Blocks 1 through 15. This block is also the only area used to tailor the document listed in Block 4. Only deletions to the minimum requirements stated in the document in Block 4 are allowed. Block 16 may also be used to specify the medium for delivery of the data. Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a ""Distribution Statement"" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings. There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings. The definition for each is as follows: A... approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. B... distribution authorized to US Governments agencies only. C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T.

All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;52088 N133379 ; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-130, REV N, 16 NOV 2012; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Electrostatic Discharge Control - The Contractor shall comply with the electrostatic discharge control requirements established in MIL-STD-1686. 3.5 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.

All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;52088 1011872-1; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.

The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes.

Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded ""no charge."" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY ""N/C"" FOR ""NO CHARGE"" is acceptable. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARK WITH THE NOMENCLATURE THAT IS CITED IN THE IRPOD.

Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.

This capability includes a new software defined receiver with a Program of Record (PoR) designation as ?Software Defined User Equipment (SDUE)? and a new digital resilient antenna electronics (RAE) package with a PoR designation of ?Soteria?.? ? An RFI for SDUE was previously posted on 02 Jul 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/47e113d4819c478c95984964d068b6fa/view. An RFI for Aircraft Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) (now Soteria) was previously posted on 17 Dec 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/fbbd846e765840ee85dd66bfd0558899/view. These RFIs were originally focused on developing the SDUE and Soteria as two separate acquisition programs. The Government now believes developing the SDUE and Soteria together as a single acquisition program will provide a lower risk approach and ensure effective interface compatibility between SDUE and Soteria. If you previously responded to these RFIs and your prior responses are still valid, then please state that your previous responses are still accurate and complete.? If you wish to provide any new or updated information to your previous RFI responses (or if you did not respond before), please provide your comments to any of the questions in the original RFI?s, as found at the links shown above.? ?? The Government is evaluating options for a planned Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) effort that may use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and the selection of a Design Agent (DA) to lead a rapid prototyping and rapid production requirements effort. The Government would like to understand prime contractor interest in accomplishing the total effort in-house or using subcontractor arrangements as necessary.? Additionally, the Government would like to understand SDUE contractor interest in accomplishing the SDUE development/rapid prototyping effort.? Similarly, the Government would like to understand Soteria contractor interest in accomplishing the Soteria development/rapid prototyping effort. Purpose/Description? Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) for a wide range of military operations. Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) data in support of this, but must be designed to ensure performance in operational environments. Currently fielded GPS receivers contribute to this necessary capability but are susceptible to degradation in electronic threat (e.g., jamming, spoofing) environments.? Advanced Anti-Jam (AJ) antenna and/or antenna electronics systems may be leveraged to reduce electronic interference in GPS radio frequency (RF) bandwidths, particularly when employing null-steering and beamforming technologies.? In many cases, the hardware and software interface between the GPS receiver and the antenna electronics is proprietary and dependent upon the vendor(s) represented.? This dependency restricts an aircraft platform?s ability to incorporate changes or upgrades to the PNT system without incurring appreciable cost and integration complexity increases associated with replacing either the AJ system, the PNT receiver, or integrated navigation Line Replaceable Units (LRU).? A more open system is intended to help counter this by providing an efficient means to modify the PNT system in response to evolving threats and updated requirements. Beyond the ?vendor lock? issue, the challenge of evolving threats and the resulting need to modify the current hardware and software may take nearly a decade to develop, test, produce, integrate, and field the next solution.? This duration is unacceptable when today?s threats are evolving at an accelerated pace.? To this end, the PNT PO is pursuing the development of a Multi-Global Navigation Satellite System (MGNSS)-capable Software Defined Receiver (SDR), known as SDUE, as well as compatible MGNSS antenna electronics, named Soteria. SDUE shall support adaptable, reprogrammable navigation solutions through the use of GPS military signals, Regional Military Protect (RMP) signals, non-GPS Satellite Navigation (SATNAV) signals, and others that may be available in the future. Soteria shall support AJ, which can take advantage of MGNSS signals, Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) signals, and flexible waveforms. The required Soteria capabilities are AJ, Anti-Spoof (AS), and Situational Awareness (SA) across the entire MGNSS/SATNAV spectrum, which encompasses all L-band frequencies. The data and control interface between Soteria and SDUE shall allow for the transmission/receipt of aiding and control data, signal and state selection messages, and beamformed data that will be required to support these capabilities. SDUE will receive from Soteria the processed I/Q beamformed measurements and nulling-only protected RF signals for all visible MGNSS satellites. Defining a physical and informational open standard for the Soteria interface is vital to employ advanced AJ/AS/SA capabilities in concert with the SDUE. It will promote competition based on performance and cost. In summary, the Government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical and physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols throughout the navigation architecture, addressing antenna subsystems and avionics architectures. Security Certified Software Defined Receiver and Standard Digital Interface The SDUE shall be a security certified, unclassified-when-keyed software defined SATNAV military receiver based on a field-programmable logic device technology (e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Array {FPGA}, Programmable Logic Device {PLD}, System on a Chip {SoC} FPGA). The design should be manufacturer-agnostic, shall implement the GPS security requirements set forth in GPU-PRD-711 and GPU-PRD-705, and comply with cyber requirements. The Government is projecting it can furnish an FPGA-based, security-certified architecture and associated intellectual property with Full/Government purpose data rights (as appropriate, and jointly agreed to) for the SDUE effort.? The security-certified architecture and intellectual property is currently being developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory under a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract with The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) on a project known as ?Janus?.? This architecture is expected to be security-certified by Dec 2025, in accordance with GPU-PRD-705. ?NOTE: An interim process/certification report will be available by late Summer 2023. Respondents are under no obligation to use what may be provided from the Janus effort to develop and deliver the required capabilities.? Respondents can use other secure, feasible, and efficient alternatives of the FPGA or devise their own architecture, as long as the Government can obtain data rights for the implemented architecture. As part of an Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD) effort, MITRE and The Ohio State University Antenna Electronics (OSU) teams are collaborating on the development of a standard interface and an interface control document (ICD). This will allow interoperability between MGNSS receivers and MGNSS beamsteering antennas, in order to break vendor lock scenarios and enable the effective and efficient insertion of new and advanced capabilities. The Government plans to engage industry to discuss the draft standard interface design with vendors, and to consider vendor inputs and recommendations, with the goal of defining a universally acceptable open interface standard. Operational Context Soteria, SDUE, and the Resilient-Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (R-EGI) are the three components that will collectively provide the Vanguard (first use) targeted capabilities necessary to deliver robust and resilient PNT to the warfighter. These three systems are envisioned to be nominally configured as shown in the attached document. The integrated capabilities of the proposed systems are shown as intended to support the effective and affordable operation of USAF, Joint/Coalition platforms, and weapon systems in evolving threat environments. It should be noted the three systems are expected to operate in a tightly coupled relationship, allowing aiding and the sharing of information to provide the desired resiliency and robustness while executing AS and SA functions. Hence, the Government is placing an emphasis on using non-proprietary open standard interfaces.

If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company or institution?s capabilities in meeting these requirements.? Failure to provide this documentation may prevent the Government from being able to assess your capabilities.? If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience or capabilities in order to perform that aspect of the requirement (i.e., through teaming or subcontracting). Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business applicants. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research.? Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged but not required. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) offerings, whether used as a contracting vehicle by a sole RFI responder or to RFI responders as part of a consortium, will be considered by the Government to achieve requirements.? RFI responders are requested to indicate any prior experience working under an OTA construct. RFI responders are requested to identify as a University Affiliated Research Center, if applicable. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, as identified on the final page of this RFI. As stated in the ?Department of Defense Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers?, version 1.1 (Jun 2013), the five principles of OSA are: Modular designs based on standards, with loose coupling and high cohesion, that allow for independent acquisition of system components. Enterprise investment strategies, based on collaboration and trust, that maximize reuse of proven hardware system designs and ensure we spend the least to get the best. Transformation of the life cycle sustainment strategies for software intensive systems through proven technology insertion and software product upgrade techniques. Dramatically lower development risk through transparency of system designs, continuous design disclosure, and Government, academia, and industry peer reviews. Strategic use of data rights to ensure a level competitive playing field and access to alternative solutions and sources, across the life cycle. As alluded to in principle 1. above, the establishment of an open Soteria standard (software and hardware) will allow one or more qualified third parties to add, modify, replace, remove, or provide support for the antenna electronics or the LRU independently. ?Moreover, while an architecture incorporating any physical layer configuration will be considered, preferred proposed solutions will minimize Group A changes, to maintain the form and fit of current antennas and antenna electronics components and connecting cables.? To this end, it will be valuable for RFI responders to present existing interface control documents, and/or to demonstrate a capability to generate a best of breed SDUE and Soteria interface solution from existing solutions or concepts. Interested parties shall provide information that demonstrates the following: Section A: New requests to address (beyond the original RFI questions) The first spiral of Soteria and SDUE, to be called the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), shall be based on the existing L1/L2 platform Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) capabilities (e.g., N79), and the use of L1/L2 GPS, L1/L2 QZSS, and Galileo E1 signals. Describe your approach and processes to satisfy the MVP requirements. Describe your approach and processes to upgrade the software and hardware (as needed) beyond the MVP requirements to allow capabilities that exploit the other MGNSS and Iridium signals existing in the band from 1160 MHz to 1627 MHz. NOTE: The Soteria SWAP is not to exceed the current ADAP SWAP.??The SDUE SWAP is not to exceed the current MGUE Inc.-I Aviation card SWAP. Given the existing SWAP and datalink limitations, describe the number of MGNSS signals to which your beamform can approach, and explain your plan to manage AJ for the remaining MGNSS signals. Describe your processes to maintain compatibility and synergy between Soteria and SDUE as new capabilities and updates are implemented in a manner to stay relevant in the evolving threat environment. It is expected that the insertion of Soteria, SDUE, and R-EGI into platforms will be staggered, for various technical and programmatic reasons. Describe your approach to enable modularity and interoperability among various combinations of CRPAs (existing and planned; for example, GSTAR, DIGAR, Soteria), GPS and MGNSS receiver modules (e.g., MGUE, SDUE), and/or PNT Line Replaceable Units (e.g., EGI-M, R-EGI).? All solutions should adhere to the principles of open systems architecture mentioned previously. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your preferred solution (which may use a teaming or prime/subcontractor plan)? Briefly describe your preferred approach and the elements involved (e.g., use of a Design Agent, prime contractor, or subcontractor) to execute the SDUE and Soteria acquisition program. NOTE: This question is optional. The Government is interested in the overall rapid prototyping cost. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for your proposed Development effort. Respondents are requested to provide a ROM estimate for the SDUE and Soteria rapid prototype phases, which can be provided as a range.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this technology for improved 5G network device security. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??????? 5G cellular networks are transforming machine-to-machine (M2M) communications by enabling millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate wirelessly. Some of the applications of this technology include factory equipment, medical devices, automated vehicles, drones, and vehicle convoys. Attacks or conditions that interrupt the wireless connectivity to automated and connected devices can lead to disastrous consequences including fatalities (e.g., death of patients supported by connected health devices and accidents involving automated vehicles and drones). The inability to use drones to aid recovery and rescue operation can hamper public safety efforts. As 5G is just being deployed, its security features are still evolving. INL?s technology will ensure that devices can be connected to the 5G network in a secure, resilient, and reliable way. Description:??? This technology involves methods for a group of connected devices in physical proximity to form a local IoT (LIoT) that enables secure, resilient, and reiable localized operations while maintaining connection to a larger parent network, such as a 5G cellular network that provides connectivity to additional devices and networks. This invention also includes a framework that adds customizable security authentication procedures for the LIoT to the existing security procedures of the parent network. The main element is to utilize proxy signatures from cryptography so that when new devices connect to the LIoT, they can present this proxy signature to the leader without any need to verify the signature with the 5G core. In this way, the number of connection requests to the core network for this enhanced security procedure is minimized. These signatures are created in advance when the IoT devices register with the 5G network. Benefits:????????? Enables reliable device authentication, preventing illegal devices to join the network. Accelerates the authentication process, which especially benefits applications needing real-time service. Not impacted by the existing traffic conditions within the parent network. Applications:?? 5G network device security Development Status:? TRL 3. This technology is undergoing proof-of-concept. ? IP Status: ???????

Overview:??? ????Future wireless networks will be heavily driven by internet of things (IoT) connectivity. Many IoT devices are in close vicinity to one another. To avoid signal collision, INL researchers had devised a signaling method that may be used to construct femtocells for serving clusters of devices that are located in a confined and coverage-limited areas. ? Description:??? This technology can be used to construct femtocells that establish communications among devices that may have a relatively small amount of data to transmit/receive. These femtocells make use of the spectrum that is already in use by the LTE network, but transmissions are made at a relatively low signal power, hence, interference to the LTE network remains negligible. The CP-DSSS signal level is kept low through three complementary mechanisms. First, since the operation is under a femtocell, the transmitted signals are naturally low-powered. Second, the spread spectrum nature of CP-DSSS allows transmissions at a level below the noise floor of the channel. Third, the use of multiple antennas at the femtocell base station adds another layer of processing gain that allows further reduction of the transmitted signal?s power. Benefits:????????? Readily transformational to any hardware. Multiple data symbols can be accommodated within each CP-DSSS signal block/frame. The addition of more data symbols leads to a higher data rate. Applications:?? Wireless communication infrastructure providers. Wireless operators Proprietary control systems. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is an early-stage concept and is need of further testing. IP Status: ??????? Patent Application No. 17/249,593, ?Spread Spectrum Communication in Femtocell Networks, and Associated Devices, Systems, and Methods,? BEA Docket No. BA-1116. ?

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

The Contractor must develop written procedures that implement the material control requirements stated herein and elsewhere in this Contract/Purchase Order. 3.16 Material Traceability - The certification data report must be identified through a unique traceability number, heat-lot number, or heat-treat number, as applicable, which must also be marked on the material. This traceability marking on the material must provide direct traceability to the material's chemical composition and mechanical properties certification data. For material produced by batch, continuous cast, or continuous pour processes, samples must be taken no less than once in every eight hours of operation for the purpose of validating proper chemical composition and mechanical properties. Traceability must be maintained through all process operations including any subcontracted operations, to the finished component. 3.16.1 Material Marking for Traceability and Identification - The following are the minimum marking requirements. Additional/alternate marking requirements, if applicable, will be specified elsewhere in the contract/purchase order. In addition to the marking requirements on applicable drawings and/or specifications, marking for traceability is required. All traceability markings must be permanently applied in accordance with MIL-STD-792 (except as specified below). An alternate marking method is permissible provided it is an available option in the contractually invoked specification or drawing, except in instances where the material has been modified by this contract/purchase order and differs from that specified in the specification or drawing. 3.16.2 Traceability markings for items with precision machined or plated surfaces, or material with suitable marking surface areas less than 3/8 inches square (either 3/8"" x 3/8"" or an area equal to 0.1406 inches square) must be applied to a durable tag and the tag securely affixed to the material. 3.16.3 Marking must be legible and must be located so as to not affect the form, fit, and function of the material. ;Marking area to be as shown on drawing.; 3.17 See CDRL DI-MISC-81020 (Chemical and Mechanical) - Material Certification - In addition to the certification data requirements specified in DI-MISC-81020, the following material certification requirements apply: 3.17.1 Quantitative chemical and mechanical analysis of material traceable to traceability markings is required. Material certification test reports must include the class, form, condition, grade, type, finish, and/or composition, as applicable, of the material supplied. 3.17.2 Re-identification and re-certification of material is required when the material is subjected to a process which alters it's properties. If the starting material or raw stock is processed in a manner that will not affect its chemical composition or mechanical properties, the original certifications for the chemical composition and mechanical properties, as required by the material specification, are acceptable. Re-certification of the chemical or mechanical properties is required if a process is used during fabrication that alters the original properties of the material (e.g. alloying, heat treating, or forming). In these instances, the properties of the material must be re-determined and documented to reflect the altered condition. The altered material must be uniquely re-identified. The properties thus determined and documented, are required for final certification and must conform to the material specification or the contract/purchase order requirements. When only the mechanical properties are altered, the original certification forchemical composition must be overstamped and annotated with the unique traceability marking used with the altered material and at a minimum contain the information below. TRACEABILITY MARKING ________________________________________________ (marking on finished item) IS FABRICATED FROM RAW MATERIAL IDENTIFIED TO HEAT/LOT NUMBER ______________ AND HEAT TREAT NUMBER ____________________ (when applicable) _________________________________________ DATE _____________________ (name and signature of auth. co. rep.) 3.17.3 Material certification data forwarded by the manufacturer must contain a signed certification that the report results represent the actual attributes of the material furnished and indicate full compliance with all applicable specification and contract requirements. Transcription of certification data is prohibited. 3.17.4 Statements on material certification documents must be positive and unqualified. Disclaimers such as ""to the best of our knowledge"" or ""we believe the information contained herein is true"" are not acceptable. 3.17.5 If material is received without the required certification papers or with incorrect/missing data on the certification papers, the material will be rejected. 3.18 Material Handling - The written material control process must include the following: 3.18.1 All raw materials must have traceability markings (except as specified below). 3.18.2 Stored raw materials requiring traceability must be segregated to preclude intermingling with materials not requiring traceability. 3.18.3 When traceability markings will be removed by a manufacturing or fabrication process, the marking must be recorded prior to removal and be immediately restored upon completion of the process. If this cannot be done or is impractical, an appropriate material control procedure (such as a bag and tag, tagging, and/or tote box control) must be employed. The material control procedure must provide a method of positive control to preclude commingling of heats/lots or loss of traceability. The traceability marking must be reapplied upon completion of the final manufacturing process. 3.18.4 Brazing or weld filler metals for strength welds forming or integral with pressure containing components or assemblies requiring traceability must be verified to be the correct material, and type or grade, as applicable, prior to consumption. At a minimum, material verification must consist of inspection of material test reports for conformance to specified requirements. Control of welding and brazing filler metals must be maintained to the point of consumption to assure use of the correct type and grade. Markings and traceability requirements do not apply to brazing and weld filler metals after consumption. It is the responsibility of the prime contractor to ensure conformance with the above requirements on welds performed by their subcontractors. 3.18.5 Purchase orders for raw material must specify that the material be traceable to material certification test reports by traceability markings on the material and identified on the test reports. The certification data requirements contained in DI-MISC-81020 must be invoked by the prime contractor on all subcontractors supplying Level I material. 3.18.6 The material control process must include requirements for the maintenance of traceability for items sent out for subcontracted operations. If such operations would remove traceability markings, purchase or work orders must specify a method and marking location for remarking. The contractor must also ensure that subcontractor production controls are adequate to preclude commingling of materials during processing. 3.19 Receiving inspection - 3.19.1 Products and services produced by sub-tier suppliers for incorporation in the contract end item must be subject to inspection or audit at the time of receipt by the prime prior to further processing within the prime contractor's plant or shipment to another location. 3.19.2 Receiving Inspection must include as a minimum - Verification that the traceability marking on the material agrees with that on the certification test reports. Verification that certification test reports are legible and complete. Verification that the contents of the certification test reports are in compliance with the contractually invoked specifications and requirements. 3.20 Discrepancy reporting - 3.20.1 Nonconforming products from sub-tier suppliers must be identified and processed in accordance with the prime contractor's procedures for controlling nonconforming products.
