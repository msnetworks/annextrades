This measurement is calculated by adding one-half ball diameter to the half stack height dimension on the drawing. Limits are determined by the ball diameter tolerance and the half stack height tolerance. Check dimensions by measuring from the seat back face to top of ball. Manufacturers of seats that do not have a ball of the required size available will be required to manufacture a dummy ball or segment of a ball with sufficient spherical surface to check the above dimension. 3.14 O-ring grooves and mating sealing surfaces must be inspected per the contractually invoked drawings or specifications. When the drawings or specifications do not provide specific defect criteria or state that no defects are allowed, the General Acceptance Criteria (GAC) standard must be used for inspecting O-ring grooves and mating sealing surfaces only. Repairs to sealing surfaces and O-ring grooves with unacceptable defects may be accomplished within the limits of the size and tolerances provided in the applicable drawing. Repairs thatwould exceed these limits require approval (including final dimensions). The data that is red lined (crossed out) is excluded from the GAC for this contract and is not to be used for acceptance or rejection criteria. The GAC document is identified as Contract Support Library Reference Number CSD008 at https://register.nslc.navy.mil/ 3.15 Specification Change - For QQ-N-281, Class B material: 1 - Footnote 9 to Table II of QQ-N-281 does not apply. 2 - When starting material is Round Bar greater than 3"" dia, the mechanical properties of Hex Bar apply. 3.16 K-MONEL Fasteners - Material must be heat treated per QQ-N-286. 3.16.1 Fasteners that have been hot or cold headed or roll threaded must be solution annealed followed by age hardening subsequent to all heading and thread rolling operations.

The Contractor must develop written procedures that implement the material control requirements stated herein and elsewhere in this Contract/Purchase Order. 3.16 Material Traceability - The certification data report must be identified through a unique traceability number, heat-lot number, or heat-treat number, as applicable, which must also be marked on the material. This traceability marking on the material must provide direct traceability to the material's chemical composition and mechanical properties certification data. For material produced by batch, continuous cast, or continuous pour processes, samples must be taken no less than once in every eight hours of operation for the purpose of validating proper chemical composition and mechanical properties. Traceability must be maintained through all process operations including any subcontracted operations, to the finished component. 3.16.1 Material Marking for Traceability and Identification - The following are the minimum marking requirements. Additional/alternate marking requirements, if applicable, will be specified elsewhere in the contract/purchase order. In addition to the marking requirements on applicable drawings and/or specifications, marking for traceability is required. All traceability markings must be permanently applied in accordance with MIL-STD-792 (except as specified below). An alternate marking method is permissible provided it is an available option in the contractually invoked specification or drawing, except in instances where the material has been modified by this contract/purchase order and differs from that specified in the specification or drawing. 3.16.2 Traceability markings for items with precision machined or plated surfaces, or material with suitable marking surface areas less than 3/8 inches square (either 3/8"" x 3/8"" or an area equal to 0.1406 inches square) must be applied to a durable tag and the tag securely affixed to the material. 3.16.3 Marking must be legible and must be located so as to not affect the form, fit, and function of the material. ;Marking area to be as shown on drawing.; 3.17 See CDRL DI-MISC-81020 (Chemical and Mechanical) - Material Certification - In addition to the certification data requirements specified in DI-MISC-81020, the following material certification requirements apply: 3.17.1 Quantitative chemical and mechanical analysis of material traceable to traceability markings is required. Material certification test reports must include the class, form, condition, grade, type, finish, and/or composition, as applicable, of the material supplied. 3.17.2 Re-identification and re-certification of material is required when the material is subjected to a process which alters it's properties. If the starting material or raw stock is processed in a manner that will not affect its chemical composition or mechanical properties, the original certifications for the chemical composition and mechanical properties, as required by the material specification, are acceptable. Re-certification of the chemical or mechanical properties is required if a process is used during fabrication that alters the original properties of the material (e.g. alloying, heat treating, or forming). In these instances, the properties of the material must be re-determined and documented to reflect the altered condition. The altered material must be uniquely re-identified. The properties thus determined and documented, are required for final certification and must conform to the material specification or the contract/purchase order requirements. When only the mechanical properties are altered, the original certification forchemical composition must be overstamped and annotated with the unique traceability marking used with the altered material and at a minimum contain the information below. TRACEABILITY MARKING ________________________________________________ (marking on finished item) IS FABRICATED FROM RAW MATERIAL IDENTIFIED TO HEAT/LOT NUMBER ______________ AND HEAT TREAT NUMBER ____________________ (when applicable) _________________________________________ DATE _____________________ (name and signature of auth. co. rep.) 3.17.3 Material certification data forwarded by the manufacturer must contain a signed certification that the report results represent the actual attributes of the material furnished and indicate full compliance with all applicable specification and contract requirements. Transcription of certification data is prohibited. 3.17.4 Statements on material certification documents must be positive and unqualified. Disclaimers such as ""to the best of our knowledge"" or ""we believe the information contained herein is true"" are not acceptable. 3.17.5 If material is received without the required certification papers or with incorrect/missing data on the certification papers, the material will be rejected. 3.18 Material Handling - The written material control process must include the following: 3.18.1 All raw materials must have traceability markings (except as specified below). 3.18.2 Stored raw materials requiring traceability must be segregated to preclude intermingling with materials not requiring traceability. 3.18.3 When traceability markings will be removed by a manufacturing or fabrication process, the marking must be recorded prior to removal and be immediately restored upon completion of the process. If this cannot be done or is impractical, an appropriate material control procedure (such as a bag and tag, tagging, and/or tote box control) must be employed. The material control procedure must provide a method of positive control to preclude commingling of heats/lots or loss of traceability. The traceability marking must be reapplied upon completion of the final manufacturing process. 3.18.4 Brazing or weld filler metals for strength welds forming or integral with pressure containing components or assemblies requiring traceability must be verified to be the correct material, and type or grade, as applicable, prior to consumption. At a minimum, material verification must consist of inspection of material test reports for conformance to specified requirements. Control of welding and brazing filler metals must be maintained to the point of consumption to assure use of the correct type and grade. Markings and traceability requirements do not apply to brazing and weld filler metals after consumption. It is the responsibility of the prime contractor to ensure conformance with the above requirements on welds performed by their subcontractors. 3.18.5 Purchase orders for raw material must specify that the material be traceable to material certification test reports by traceability markings on the material and identified on the test reports. The certification data requirements contained in DI-MISC-81020 must be invoked by the prime contractor on all subcontractors supplying Level I material. 3.18.6 The material control process must include requirements for the maintenance of traceability for items sent out for subcontracted operations. If such operations would remove traceability markings, purchase or work orders must specify a method and marking location for remarking. The contractor must also ensure that subcontractor production controls are adequate to preclude commingling of materials during processing. 3.19 Receiving inspection - 3.19.1 Products and services produced by sub-tier suppliers for incorporation in the contract end item must be subject to inspection or audit at the time of receipt by the prime prior to further processing within the prime contractor's plant or shipment to another location. 3.19.2 Receiving Inspection must include as a minimum - Verification that the traceability marking on the material agrees with that on the certification test reports. Verification that certification test reports are legible and complete. Verification that the contents of the certification test reports are in compliance with the contractually invoked specifications and requirements. 3.20 Discrepancy reporting - 3.20.1 Nonconforming products from sub-tier suppliers must be identified and processed in accordance with the prime contractor's procedures for controlling nonconforming products. The prime contractor must report the receipt of any nonconforming products to the responsible sub-tier supplie..."

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract wards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was stablished to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under his informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed."

An alternate marking method is permissible provided it is an available option in the contractually invoked specification or drawing, except in instances where the material has been modified by this contract/purchase order and differs from that specified in the specification or drawing. 3.19.2 Traceability markings for items with precision machined or plated surfaces, or material with suitable marking surface areas less than 3/8 inches square (either 3/8"" x 3/8"" or an area equal to 0.1406 inches square) must be applied to a durable tag and the tag securely affixed to the material. 3.19.3 Permanent marking must be legible and must be located so as to not affect the form, fit, and function of the material. ;Ball must be marked in the waterway and Seats to be marked on the outer cylindrical surface.; 3.19.4 Seat Marking - Each seat must be permanently marked in accordance with MIL-STD-792, type I and as stated below, except for Teflon seats, which must only be tagged. Type IX marking may be substituted for type I, provided the minimum character size scribed by the marking tool must be approximately 3/32 inch high to insure legibility. Permanent marking is not permitted on Teflon seats. Seat marking requirements must maintain complete traceability to certification OQE. Seat marking must be either heat/lot or batch number, a vendor traceability number/code, or a combination thereof and must be unique to the material certification. 3.19.5 Traceability markings must be maintained through assembly, and whenever possible must be visible after assembly. For items where the marking is not visible after assembly, a durable tag must be securely attached to the item identifying the part number, piece number, traceability number, and the location of the permanent mark. 3.20 See CDRL-DI-MISC-81020 (Chemical and Mechanical) and CDRL DI-MISC-80678 (SEAT MATERIAL) - Material Certifications - The following material certification requirements apply: 3.20.1 Metallic Material - Quantitative chemical and mechanical analysis of material traceable to traceability markings is required.

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.4.1 NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG. 3.4.2 NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG. 3.4.3 ;IAW 6873683 rev ""B"" note 4.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the TRANSMITTER,SONAR S furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;5728260; cage ;53711; . 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Electrostatic Discharge Control - The Contractor shall comply with the electrostatic discharge control requirements established in MIL-STD-1686. 3.4 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E.

Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.4.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.5 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ANTENNA CONTROL GRP furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;53711 7649065; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ANTENNA CONTROL GRP furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;53711 7649065; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

The Government is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, cost, and functionality of Information Technology (IT) tools, applications or products capable of satisfying the life-cycle technical, functional, operational, and/or capabilities described in this RFI. Any information submitted by respondents to this request is strictly voluntary.? This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach.? The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses from this RFI or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the use of such information.? All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and market research purposes only.? To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.? Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.? The Government shall not be liable for damages related to proprietary information that is not properly identified.? Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.? BACKGROUND: Future Special Operations may be conducted in complex, shallow-water, cluttered littoral environments.? Communication, understanding and reacting to threats that pose significant risk to the warfighter and other assets is critical to mission success. ?As enhanced resources are deployed, underwater communication devices that provide greater situational awareness are paramount to minimize risk and accomplish the mission. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) is seeking white papers from industry, academia, individuals and government organizations capable of providing research, design, and testing of the objectives described below. The Goal of this RFI is to research, discover and evaluate technologies that will accelerate the delivery of advanced capabilities to enhance communications and that will provide an asymmetrical warfare advantage during Diving operations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on best practices, technology solutions and cost estimates for Underwater Diver communication modular payloads and enhancements specific to the two objectives stated below. ?NUWCDIVNPT is interested in information for the following objectives. Objective 1: Investigate Diver communication payloads that can be integrated and worn by a diver, to facilitate and enhance reliable communications between divers which can include diver to diver, and diver to platform communication.? The communication technology must be able to be worn by a diver, portable, maximize Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) and if possible provide ease of operation switching from underwater environment to shore. ?It is desired for the proposed capabilities to achieve maximum situational awareness from the smallest possible devices to improve decision making across multiple communication modalities.? The ability of the Diver to effectively communicate between divers is paramount as is the capability to establish communications between multiple deployed communication systems in the operational environment. Objective 2: Investigate commercial or developmental underwater communication capability enhancements that will result in increased Diver capabilities and positional/placement accuracy and enhanced situational awareness.? The ease with which these capability enhancements are compatible and can be integrated into commercial or other government underwater network is of interest.? Submittals that suggest a developmental technology, vehicle or other method to deliver the enhanced communications from an underwater platform will be accepted and reviewed in the study. ?Vulnerability to the diver and of the underwater capability should be provided as well. REQUESTED INFORMATION: The government is seeking white papers on the objectives stated above.? White papers can address either objective, or both of the objectives.? At a minimum, white papers should include the technical solution addressing these objectives and the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the solution(s).? The government is also interested in the cost for procurement of off the shelf solutions and developmental costs (if applicable) for solutions that require further development.? Provide the following business information: Company name, address, phone number Company website link Company cage code Point of Contact name, email, and phone number, for further clarification or questions.

The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive or sole source contract.? 2. BACKGROUND The MCSC has an Approved Acquisition Objective to procure 111 MSAT systems beginning in or around Fiscal Year 24. The MSAT provides Marine forces assured SATCOM capabilities for operation through anticipated contested electronic warfare environments of near-peer and nation-state competitors. The system must be man-portable to support Expeditionary Advanced Based Operation and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment that have the distinctive operational characteristic of employing small, highly dispersed, and mobile teams. The MSAT will operate through SHF denied environments. It will provide technologies to mitigate jamming of its communications circuits. Additionally, it will provide technologies that limit the detection and monitoring of emissions. The size, weight, and power consumption of the system will be optimized for a system transit footprint of two cases (or less) that are each man-portable and fit in a commercial aircraft cabin overhead storage bin. The ultimate objective would be for a system that is man-packable in a single backpack. MSAT should support information throughputs of 8 Mbps or less. 3. DESCRIPTION Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Portfolio Manager, Command Element Systems, Program Manager Communications Systems, Product Manager Satellite Communications (SATCOM) seeks industry feedback and information on specific industry capabilities for a SATCOM Man-Portable Secure Anti-Jam Terminal (MSAT) solution. Feedback gathered from this effort will be compiled and used to refine the solicitation for a potential contracting effort in the future. The MSAT is a system within the Marine Corps Wideband Satellite Communications Family of Systems that provides deployed Marine forces operational capabilities to both maintain Command and Control of current and future dispersed operational units and to access Defense Information Systems Network services. The MSAT will provide assured broadband communications for units in environments where normal Super High Frequency (SHF) communications (military and civilian) are degraded or denied. A degraded or denied environment is defined as existing when an adversary uses active measures to disrupt normal satellite communications.? 4. RESPONSE REQUESTED The purpose of this RFI is to provide Marine Corps decision makers with a better understanding of existing systems and technologies for MSAT design and development. Responses may leverage existing military systems (e.g., Advanced Extremely High Frequency, Evolved Strategic SATCOM) or commercial systems. The Government requests respondents provide comments on the questions outlined below. Responses shall be limited to 15 pages or less. The Marine Corps is requesting the following information: Identify existing technologies and operational approaches to communicating in a denied or degraded environment. Identify off the shelf technologies and products that could provide the capabilities identified in (1) for MSAT. Identify the likelihood of systems identified in (2) to meet MSAT portability objectives for in-transit size and weight, and data throughput. Identify an estimated production lead-time for development and production of a MSAT system that provides the capabilities identified in (1) through (3), including any certification processes. 5. RFI RESPONSES Provide all feedback to lisa.bennett@usmc.mil and kassidy.probst@usmc.mil no later than the closing date listed in Section 1.? Please place ?MSAT RFI Response? in the subject line of your e-mail. After reviewing comments, the Government may set up a teleconference to discuss respondent?s information packages.

GENERAL INFORMATION Document Type: Request for Information (RFI) / Market Research Sources Sought: All Businesses ? Under North American Industry Classification System Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications. Closing Date for RFI: 10 June 2022 at 11 am, local time, Quantico, Virginia THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) OR PROPOSAL (RFP). This RFI is a market research tool, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, to determine the availability and adequacy of potential solutions prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a RFP. The Government will not reimburse for any information received from potential sources in response to this RFI. Any costs incurred responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent?s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition. This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive or sole source contract.? 2. BACKGROUND The MCSC has an Approved Acquisition Objective to procure 111 MSAT systems beginning in or around Fiscal Year 24. The MSAT provides Marine forces assured SATCOM capabilities for operation through anticipated contested electronic warfare environments of near-peer and nation-state competitors. The system must be man-portable to support Expeditionary Advanced Based Operation and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment that have the distinctive operational characteristic of employing small, highly dispersed, and mobile teams. The MSAT will operate through SHF denied environments. It will provide technologies to mitigate jamming of its communications circuits. Additionally, it will provide technologies that limit the detection and monitoring of emissions. The size, weight, and power consumption of the system will be optimized for a system transit footprint of two cases (or less) that are each man-portable and fit in a commercial aircraft cabin overhead storage bin. The ultimate objective would be for a system that is man-packable in a single backpack. MSAT should support information throughputs of 8 Mbps or less. 3. DESCRIPTION Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Portfolio Manager, Command Element Systems, Program Manager Communications Systems, Product Manager Satellite Communications (SATCOM) seeks industry feedback and information on specific industry capabilities for a SATCOM Man-Portable Secure Anti-Jam Terminal (MSAT) solution. Feedback gathered from this effort will be compiled and used to refine the solicitation for a potential contracting effort in the future. The MSAT is a system within the Marine Corps Wideband Satellite Communications Family of Systems that provides deployed Marine forces operational capabilities to both maintain Command and Control of current and future dispersed operational units and to access Defense Information Systems Network services. The MSAT will provide assured broadband communications for units in environments where normal Super High Frequency (SHF) communications (military and civilian) are degraded or denied. A degraded or denied environment is defined as existing when an adversary uses active measures to disrupt normal satellite communications.? 4. RESPONSE REQUESTED The purpose of this RFI is to provide Marine Corps decision makers with a better understanding of existing systems and technologies for MSAT design and development. Responses may leverage existing military systems (e.g., Advanced Extremely High Frequency, Evolved Strategic SATCOM) or commercial systems. The Government requests respondents provide comments on the questions outlined below. Responses shall be limited to 15 pages or less. The Marine Corps is requesting the following information: Identify existing technologies and operational approaches to communicating in a denied or degraded environment. Identify off the shelf technologies and products that could provide the capabilities identified in (1) for MSAT. Identify the likelihood of systems identified in (2) to meet MSAT portability objectives for in-transit size and weight, and data throughput. Identify an estimated production lead-time for development and production of a MSAT system that provides the capabilities identified in (1) through (3), including any certification processes. 5. RFI RESPONSES Provide all feedback to lisa.bennett@usmc.mil and kassidy.probst@usmc.mil no later than the closing date listed in Section 1.? Please place ?MSAT RFI Response? in the subject line of your e-mail. After reviewing comments, the Government may set up a teleconference to discuss respondent?s information packages. Vendors submitting confidential business information or proprietary information bear the sole responsibility for appropriately marking the information.? To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information.? DO NOT SUBMIT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN YOUR RESPONSE.? Please be advised that submissions will not be returned. 6. NOTICE Vendors are advised that the Government may use non-government personnel to assist in collecting and reviewing market information and in providing technical advice to the SATCOM team.? Proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by Subsection 27 of the Office of Procurement Policy Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 423) (hereinafter referred to as ?the Procurement Integrity Act,? or ?the Act?), and as implemented in the FAR.? Supporting personnel are procurement officials within the meaning of the Act and will take all necessary action to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of vendor?s proprietary data.

RESPONSE DATE This announcement will remain open through the response date indicated or until extended or replaced by a successor BAA. White Papers may be submitted any time during this period. 4. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION 4.1 SUMMARY NAVSEA, on behalf of the Electric Ships Office (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office Ships) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in current and future shipboard electric power and energy systems at the major component, subsystem and system level. The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship power systems to the Navy by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy, industry, and academia investments. PMS 320 will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships. 4.2 NAVAL POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP Naval power and energy systems are described in detail in the 2019 Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (NPES TDR). The NPES TDR focuses and aligns the power system investments for the Navy, Defense Department, industry and academia to guide future research and development investments to enable the Navy to leverage these investments to meet its future needs more affordably. Included in the NPES TDR are specific recommendations and opportunities for near, mid and long term investments, with a renewed focus on energy management. These opportunities range from an energy magazine to support advanced weapons and sensors to the development of an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES). The NPES TDR aligns electric power system developments with war fighter needs and enables capability-based budgeting. The NPES TDR is responding to the emerging needs of the Navy, and while the plan is specific in its recommendations, it is inherently flexible enough to adapt to the changing requirements and threats that may influence the 30-year ship acquisition plan. The first section of the roadmap establishes why NPES are a critical part of the kill chain based on the capabilities desired by the Navy in the near term, as well as supporting future platforms in the Navys 30-year shipbuilding plan. The second section of the roadmap presents power and energy requirements that are derived from mission systems necessary to support future warfighting needs. The third section describes required initiatives based on capabilities and the projected electrical requirements of the future ships. 4.3 FOCUS AREAS The areas of focus for this BAA include, but are not limited to, the ""FYDP/NEAR-TERM"" activities as described throughout the NPES TDR; the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard (both manned and unmanned) electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, electric propulsion, power conversion, energy storage, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system and component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; and power system simplicity, upgradeability, flexibility, and ruggedness. The Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them. For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management). For ship service electrical loads, the architecture includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application. Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency, power density improvements and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies. The NPES TDR partitions the power system in to functional areas that include the following. 4.3.1 ENERGY STORAGE Energy storage modules may support short duration to long duration energy storage applications, which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system. For the short duration energy storage applications, the module should provide hold-up power to uninterruptible loads for fault clearing and transient isolation, as well as load leveling for pulse power loads. For the mid duration, the module should provide up to approximately 3MW (100 - 150 kW-hr) of standby power for pulse power loads while also providing continuity of operations for a subset of equipment between uninterruptible and full ships load (including emergency power generation starting in a dark ship condition). For long duration applications, energy storage modules should provide the required power as an emergency backup system or to provide increased stealth for specialty equipment. The required duration for this type of application may extend up to days or longer, and may be intermittent or continuous. A number of energy storage technologies for future ship applications are of interest to the Navy, including various electrochemical, capacitor-based, or rotating discussed below: a. Capacitor: Electrochemical capacitor improvements continue to focus on improving energy density while maintaining inherently high-power density. Design improvements include development and integration of higher temperature films, advanced electrolytes, advanced electrode materials, and minimizing equivalent series resistance (ESR). b. Rotating: The Navy has interest in the investment from the transportation industry in flywheel systems that can handle gyroscopic forces continues to support flywheel usage in commercial rail and ground transportation. Additional factors of interest to the Navy include safety, recharge/discharge rates, ship motion impacts, environmental impacts and control. c. Electrochemical: Factors of interest to the Navy with respect to electrochemical energy storage include the ability to maintain state of charge when not in use; change in voltage versus state of charge; charge and discharge capability; the temporary or permanent loss of capacity due to repeated shallow discharges; the ability to shallow charge and discharge or partially charge intermittently during a discharge; battery life considerations such as service-life, cycle life, and shelf-life; off-gas properties that affect the level of ventilation and associated auxiliary systems; and safety enhancements to support qualification for use onboard US Navy ships. Near term Navy interests are in the area of common and scalable hardware and software elements which enable advanced weapons and sensors and in understanding the sizing algorithms for how to optimize energy storage sizing against various competing system requirements (short duration/high power vs. long duration/low power, for example. The specific design issues to be considered include reliability, volumetric and gravimetric power and energy densities, differentiating between high levels of stored energy and high energy density. The relevant information required for characterizing technology performance include: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of components and systems; production capability; safety evaluation and qualifications performed on relevant subsystems or components (any hazard analyses of systems designs as relevant to notional applications); other military application of the devices; energy storage management system approach; thermal characteristics, constraints, and cooling requirements; auxiliary requirements (load); device impedance (heat generation characteristics); and device efficiency (discharge/recharge). 4.3.2 POWER CONVERSION Industry continues to drive towards increased power density, increased efficiency, higher switching frequencies, and refined topologies with associated control schemes. Innovation in power conversion from the development and implementation of wide-bandgap devices, such as Silicon Carbide (SiC), promise reduction in losses many times over Silicon. The use of high frequency transformers can provide galvanic isolation with reduced size and weight compared to traditional transformers. Advances in cooling methods will be required to handle larger heat loads associated with higher power operation. A typical Navy power conversion module might consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer. Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, are of particular interest. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to address converting high voltage AC/DC to 1000 VDC with power levels on the order of 3MW or larger. The specific design issues to be considered include modularity, open architecture (focusing on future power system flexibility and the ability of a conversion module within a ships power system to be replaced/ upgraded in support of lifecycle mission system upgrades), reliability, cost, and conversion efficiency. Areas of interest include more power-dense converters supporting advanced mission systems and prototyping of full scale conversion based on second generation wide-bandgap devices. 4.3.3 POWER DISTRIBUTION Power distribution typically consists of bus duct/ bus pipe, cables, connections, switchgear and fault protection equipment, load centers, and other hardware necessary to deliver power from generators to loads. Industry has used medium voltage DC (MVDC) transmission as a method to reduce losses across long distances. Complementarily, Industry is developing MVDC circuit protection for use in MVDC transmission variants of approximately 50, 100, and 150 megawatts (MW) at transmission voltages of 20 to 50 kVDC. Analysis includes modeling and simulation to determine methods for assessing the benefits of DC vs AC undersea transmission and distribution systems for offshore oil and gas. Industry and academia continue to invest resources in advanced conductors that have applications in power distribution, power generation, and propulsion. Research is focused on using carbon nanotubes. The development of a room temperature, lightweight, low resistance conductor is of great interest to the Navy. Areas of interest include development of an MVDC distribution system up to 12 kVDC to meet maximum load demands; design of an appropriate in-zone distribution system architecture; development of high speed 1 kVDC and 12 kVDC solid state circuit protection devices that are ship ready, and advanced conductors capable of supporting power distribution. 4.3.4 PRIME MOVERS (INCLUDING POWER GENERATION) Power Generation converts fuel into electrical power. A typical power generation module might consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine (prime mover), a generator (see rotating machine discussion below), a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible power generation technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts. Power generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive. NPES DC technologies permit prime movers and other electrical sources (such as energy storage) to operate at different, non-60Hz electrical frequency speeds, improving survivability, resiliency, and operational availability. Energy storage that is fully integrated with the power generation can enable uninterrupted power to high priority loads, mission systems that reduce susceptibility, and damage control systems to enable enhanced recoverability. The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, module level power density, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, system grounding approaches, fault protection, response to large dynamic (step) or pulse type loading originated from ship propulsion or directed energy/electromagnetic weapons, interface to main or ship service bus, autonomy, limited maintenance, and commercial availability. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to power generation in the 5 to 30 MW range, utilizing gas turbines, diesel engines and other emerging power technologies that address challenges associated with achieving reduced fuel consumption, decreased life cycle and acquisition cost, support of ship integration, enable flexibility, enable power upgrades, and improved environmental compliance. Near term Navy interest includes 10-30 MW (nominally 25 MW) output power rating and the power generation source able to supply two independent electrical buses (where abnormal conditions, including pulsed/stochastic loads, on one bus do not impact the other bus) at 12 kVDC (while also considering 6kVDC, 18kVDC, and 1 kVDC). Enhanced fuel injection, higher operating temperatures and pressures, and optimized thermal management are critical for future prime movers. Advanced controls for increased efficiency, reduced maintenance, and increased reliability include implementation of digital controls; autonomous and unmanned power control; enhanced engine monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics; and distributed controls. Advanced designs for increased efficiency include new applications of thermodynamic cycles such as Humphrey/Atkinson cycle for gas turbines and diesels and Miller cycle for diesel. The Navy is interested in developing a knowledge bank of information on potential generator sets, generator electrical interface requirements, and the impacts of those requirements on generator set performance and size, as a logical next step from the Request for Information released under announcement N00024-16-R-4205. A long-term goal for this effort is to maximize military effectiveness through design choice and configuration option flexibility when developing next-generation distribution plants. The power generation source should fit within the length of a typical engine room (46 feet, including allowances for any needed maintenance and component removal). The power generation source is expected to have the ability to: control steady-state voltage-current characteristic for its interface; to maintain stability; and to adjust control set-points from system level controllers. For any proposed design approach, initial efforts would include conceptual design trade studies that inform the performance level that can be achieved. Trade studies may address Pulsed Load Capability (generator/rectifier design to increase pulse load capability, engine speed variation limits, and impact of cyclic pulse load on component life); Power Density (cost vs. benefits of high speed or high frequency, mounting on common skid, and advanced cooling concepts); Single vs. Dual Outputs (continuous vs. pulse rating for each output, voltage regulation with shared field, and control of load sharing); Efficiency (part load vs. full load optimization, flexible speed regulation, impact of intake and exhaust duct size/pressure drop on engine efficiency); Power Quality (voltage transient, voltage modulation for step, pulse loads, impact of voltage and current ripple requirements, and common mode current); PGM Controls (prime mover speed vs. generator field vs. rectifier active phase angle control, and pulse anticipation); Stability when operating in parallel with other sources; Short Circuit Requirements; and Dark Ship start capability (self-contained support auxiliaries). Trade studies may also address how rotational energy storage can be built into the design of the generator or added to the generator and what parameters need to be defined in order to exploit this capability. Development of advanced coatings and materials that support high temperature operations of a gas turbine is also of interest. Energy harvesting to convert heat energy and specifically low quality heat energy to electricity using solid state components is also of interest to the Navy. 4.3.5 ROTATING MACHINES (INCLUDING GENERATORS AND PROPULSION MOTORS) Recent trends in electrical machines include neural networks; artificial intelligence; expert system; fiber communications and integrated electronics; new ceramic conducting and dielectric materials; and magnetic levitation. High Temperature Superconducting rotors have higher power density than their induction and synchronous rotor counterparts. Wind power generators eliminate excitation losses which can account for 30% of total generator losses. The offshore wind power industry is moving to larger power wind tower generators in the 10MW class. Advanced low resistance room temperature wire and HTS shows promise for these higher power levels because of low excitation losses and low weight due to reduction in stator and rotor iron. HTS motors may be up to 50% smaller and lighter than traditional iron-core and copper machines. They have reduced harmonic vibrations due to minimization of flux path iron and have mitigated thermal cycling failures due to precision control of temperature. Propulsion motor concepts of interest to the Navy include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC). The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, thermal management, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints. Motor drives that may be explored include cyclo-converter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type). Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate as a motor and a generator to facilitate a PDSS installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed. Areas of interest for future rotating machines include increased magnetic material flux carrying or flux generation capacity; improved electrical insulation material and insulation system dielectric strength; increased mechanical strength, increased thermal conductivity, and reduced sensitivity to temperature; improved structural materials and design concepts that accept higher torsional and electromagnetically induced stress; innovative and aggressive cooling to allow improved thermal management and increased current loading; increased electrical conductor current carrying capacity and loss reduction. 4.3.6 COOLING AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT As the demand and complexity of high energy loads increases, so does the demand and complexity of thermal management solutions. Assessing and optimizing the effectiveness of a thermal management system requires the analysis of thermal energy acquisition, thermal energy transport, and thermal energy rejection, storage, and conversion. The design of the thermal management system aims to transfer the thermal energy loads at the sources to the sinks in the most efficient manner. Areas of interest to the Navy with respect to cooling and thermal management include the application of two phased cooling and other advanced cooling techniques to power electronics and other NPES components and innovative approaches to manage overall ship thermal management issues including advanced thermal architectures, thermal energy storage systems, increases in efficiency, and advanced control philosophies. 4.3.7 POWER CONTROLS Controls manage power and energy flow within the ship to ensure delivery to the right load in the right form at the right time. Supervisory power system control typically resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore does not include hardware elements unless specialized hardware is required. The challenge to implement Tactical Energy Management (TEM) is to integrate energy storage, power generation, and interfaces with advanced warfighting systems and controls. TEM is critical to enabling full utilization of the capabilities possible from technologies under development. The state complexity and combat engagement timelines for notional future warfighting scenarios are expected to exceed the cognitive capacity and response times of human operators to effectively manage the electric plant via existing control system schema in support of executing ship missions. The survivability requirements for military ships combined with the higher dynamic power characterisitics (pulse load) characteristics of some mission systems will require more sophisticated control interfaces, power management approaches, and algorithms than are commercially available. The Navy is pursuing a long term strategy to create a unified, cyber secure architecture for machinery control systems that feature a common, reusable, cyber hardened machinery control domain specific infrastructure elements; a mechanism for transitioning new technology from a variety of sources in an efficient and consistent manner; and a mechanism to provide life cycle updates and support in a cost effective and timely manner.?TEM controls will be expected to maintain awareness of the electric plant operating state (real time modeling); interface with ship mission planning (external to the electric plant control systems) for energy resource prioritization, planning, and coordination towards the identification of resource allocation states that dynamically optimize mission effectiveness; identify and select optimal trajectories to achieving those optimal resource allocation states; and actuate the relevant electric plant components to move the electric plant state along those optimized trajectories towards the optimal resource allocation state. TEM controls would enable reduced power and energy system resource requirements for a given capability (or improved capability for a given set of resources); increased adaptability of the Navy?s power and energy system design to keep pace with an evolving threat environment; and maximized abilities to execute the ship?s mission. The Navy is interested in potential applications of distributed control architectures that have led to the development of intelligent agents that have some autonomous ability to reason about system state and enact appropriate control policies. A simple example of these agents in a control system is the use of autonomous software coupled with smart meters in a smart grid implementation. The agents, smart meters in this example, can temporarily shut off air conditioning but not the refrigerator in residences during grid peak power usage times when the cost per watt is highest on hot days. The agent software acts autonomously within its authority to comply with programmed customer desires. The Navy is interested in TEM controls within a modular open systems architecture framework such that they are agnostic of, but affordably customizable to, specific ship platforms and power system architectures.? TEM controls may reside between (i.e. interface with) embedded layers within individual power system components, ships? supervisory machinery control systems, and ships? mission planning systems. Initial or further development or modification of these interfaces may be required to achieve desired performance behaviors and characteristics. TEM controls are expected to develop within a model-based system engineering and digital engineering environment and will be initially evaluated in a purely computational environment, representing Navy-developed shipboard-representative power and energy system architecture(s), but will be progressively evaluated on systems with increasing levels of physical instantiation (i.e., controller-hardware-in-loop and power-hardware-in-loop with progressive levels of representative power system components physically instantiated). When implementing a TEM based control scheme, the overall power system should increase installed power generation available to mission and auxiliary loads; reduce power system design margins; hone the installed stored energy required for mission critical capability; and allow higher power transients (ramp rates and step loads). Other areas of interest to the Navy with respect to controls include improvements to traditional machinery control and automation, advanced power management, cyber security, and advanced controls for distributed shared energy storage and maintaining electrical system stability. The Navy is also interested in non-intrusive load monitoring, power system data analytics, real time system monitoring and onboard analysis and diagnostics capabilities. 4.3.8 SYSTEM INTERPLAY, INTERFACING, AND INTEGRATION Increasingly, the Navy is recognizing the need for incorporating flexibility and adaptability into initial ship designs and recognizing that the integration of new systems and the ability to rapidly reconfigure them will be an ongoing challenge throughout a platform's life cycle in order to maintain warfighting relevancy. The ability to support advanced electrical payload warfighting technologies requires not only power and energy systems delivered with the flexibility and adaptability to accommodate them, but a NPES engineering enterprise with the capability and capacity (knowledge, labor, and capital) for continuous systems integration. The Navy can more affordably meet this challenge by shifting as much effort as possible into the computational modeling and simulation regime. An Integrated Power System (IPS) provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, energy storage, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system. Adding Energy Storage and advanced controls to IPS results in an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) in order to accommodate future high energy weapons and sensors. The IPES Energy Magazine is available to multiple users, and provides enhanced power continuity to the power distribution system. The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ships mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC). Systems engineering in IPS/IPES is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types (both manned and unmanned) and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy-controlled. IPES offers the potential to reduce signatures by changing the frequency and amplitude of acoustic and electromagnetic emissions. Integrated energy storage can reduce observability by enabling the reduction and elimination of prime movers, thereby reducing thermal and acoustic signatures. The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to new construction and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness. Areas of Navy interest are to continuously improve IPS/IPES by performing analysis, modeling and simulation..."

The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The Government will evaluate quotes for acceptability, but will not rank the quotes by the non-price factors. If the Government receives three (3) or fewer initial quotes, all quotes will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. If the Government receives more than three (3) initial quotes, the Government will only select the three (3) lowest TEP quotes and then evaluate them for Technical Acceptability. The Government reserves the right to evaluate additional quotes for technical acceptability if it is in the Government?s best interest to do so. If additional quotes are evaluated for technical acceptability, they will be selected in the order of TEP. An offeror?s TEP will be the sum of all CLINS 0001 through 0004. EVALUATION FACTORS The Government anticipates awarding a contract to the offeror whose quote provides the best value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate quotes based on an unacceptable and acceptable rating for the following technical factor - Work Plan/Schedule (Volume I) must show completion of project within 180 calendar days from the date of contract.? Volume II Price must include page 1 of this solicitation and a price breakdown. Volume I - TECHNICAL FACTOR The technical quote shall include a clear description of your company?s understanding of Attachment 2, SOW, its requirements, specifications, and means to complete the project.

Work Plan/Schedule must show completion of project within 180 calendar days from date of contract. An offer must be rated ?technically acceptable? in order to be eligible for award. A ?technically unacceptable? rating will deem the proposal ineligible for award. The Government will utilize the information provided by the offeror in making a technical acceptability determination. If an Offeror?s technical quote is determined to be technically unacceptable, no further evaluation will be conducted. The technical evaluation factors upon which an offeror?s technical quote will be evaluated and the respective standard of acceptability for each of the technical evaluation factors are set forth below. The following adjectival ratings and rating definitions will be used to assign a rating for each technical factor and an overall rating to each technical quote. Adjectival Rating Description???? Acceptable Meets all requirements of the Solicitation and indicates an adequate or more than adequate approach and understanding of the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work. Unacceptable Does not meet requirements of the solicitation and contains one or more deficiencies.

A price reasonableness will be based on competitive quotes/offers or based on other reasonable basis such as market research, comparison of the independent Government estimate, etc. ASSUMPTIONS, CONDITIONS & EXCEPTIONS Any exception to the solicitation may render a quote unacceptable.

Failure to meet a requirement or adhere to the terms and conditions of this solicitation may result in a quote/proposal being determined ineligible for award. Award will be made to the offeror who has the lowest technically acceptable total evaluated price (TEP), meets all requirements of solicitation and SOW, and is deemed responsible in accordance with FAR Part 9. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The Government will evaluate quotes for acceptability, but will not rank the quotes by the non-price factors. If the Government receives three (3) or fewer initial quotes, all quotes will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. If the Government receives more than three (3) initial quotes, the Government will only select the three (3) lowest TEP quotes and then evaluate them for Technical Acceptability. The Government reserves the right to evaluate additional quotes for technical acceptability if it is in the Government?s best interest to do so. If additional quotes are evaluated for technical acceptability, they will be selected in the order of TEP. An offeror?s TEP will be the sum of all CLINS 0001 through 0004. EVALUATION FACTORS The Government anticipates awarding a contract to the offeror whose quote provides the best value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate quotes based on an unacceptable and acceptable rating for the following technical factor - Work Plan/Schedule (Volume I) must show completion of project within 180 calendar days from the date of contract.? Volume II Price must include page 1 of this solicitation and a price breakdown. Volume I - TECHNICAL FACTOR The technical quote shall include a clear description of your company?s understanding of Attachment 2, SOW, its requirements, specifications, and means to complete the project.

This will list approximately how many days each remote work site location will take for completion. It will also list the travel involved to each remote site in between the (4) project locations. Work Plan/Schedule must show completion of project within 180 calendar days from date of contract. An offer must be rated ?technically acceptable? in order to be eligible for award. A ?technically unacceptable? rating will deem the proposal ineligible for award. The Government will utilize the information provided by the offeror in making a technical acceptability determination. If an Offeror?s technical quote is determined to be technically unacceptable, no further evaluation will be conducted. The technical evaluation factors upon which an offeror?s technical quote will be evaluated and the respective standard of acceptability for each of the technical evaluation factors are set forth below. The following adjectival ratings and rating definitions will be used to assign a rating for each technical factor and an overall rating to each technical quote. Adjectival Rating Description???? Acceptable Meets all requirements of the Solicitation and indicates an adequate or more than adequate approach and understanding of the requirements in accordance with the Statement of Work. Unacceptable Does not meet requirements of the solicitation and contains one or more deficiencies.

Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if in the Contracting Officer?s opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional information will be requested.? However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists: offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.
