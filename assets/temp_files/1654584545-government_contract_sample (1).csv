Day meeting will be held on May 11, 2022 from 10:30 am to 5:00 pm EDT to introduce the SMART ePANTS program to potential proposers and to provide information on technical requirements and program objectives. To attend the event, participants must register (https://www.client-meeting.net/smart-epants-conference/) prior to Tuesday May 10, 2022 at 12 PM EDT. Same day registrations will not be accepted. Overview: The IARPA SMART ePANTS program aims to develop sensor systems that can record and store audio, video and location data. For maximum comfort and dexterity of the user, additional program objectives include sensor integration into clothing, where the garment maintains similar stretchability, bendability, surface roughness and washability attributes to a comparable garment containing no sensor. SMART ePANTS sensor systems must also be safely worn against the skin, be reusable, and be capable of exporting the data they gather to an external data storage device (such as a computer hard drive). Sensor systems will be entirely incorporated into garment components, especially fibers, yarn and fabric, but may include (to a limited extent) expected commercial (i.e., currently available for sale) garment accessories such as buttons, grommets, zippers, piping or collar stays. *****PLEASE REVIEW ATTACHED 'SMART ePANTS Proposers Day Announcement' DOCUMENT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS*****"

The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Further funding discussions will be contained the AOI. Notifications of Award and Protests Unsuccessful offerors shall receive notification of award and small business status of awardees.? Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ?

Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this rapid separation of Ta-185 radioisotopes technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Short-lived radioisotopes are important for any application aiming to limit a radiological dose. Most radiopharmaceuticals have half-lives of several days as the time required between production, separation, drug incorporation, and delivery to the patient can take several days to a week. INL?s technology would accelerate this process by producing the isotopes on-demand at the point of use. By introducing a fast separation method, the total isotope preparation time would be reduced drastically to only ~1-2 hours. Description:?? ?INL?s technology utilizes nuclear instrumentation and a modular rapid chemical separation system developed at INL to produce ultra-short-lived radionuclides such as Ta-185, in-house and on-demand. The key features of the method are production of Ta-185 via irradiation of W-186 with a linear accelerator, an optimized irradiation method for maximum Ta-185 production and rapid chemical separation technique utilizing a stream-lined rapid chromatographic isotope separation system (S-RCISS) to quickly separate and isolate Ta-185. Benefits:??? ?????? Novel separation system drastically surpassing rapidity of current systems. The rapid separation allows on-site and on-demand production of radioisotopes. ? Applications:?? Radioisotope applications. Opens up a new market for ultra-short-lived radioisotope applications. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is an early-stage concept and needs further testing. IP Status: ??????? Provisional Patent Application No. 63/203,858, ?Methods for Producing Radionuclides Using Accelerator Bremsstrahlung Irradiation and Rapid Chromatographic Isotope Separation,? BEA Docket No. 1252 Additional Information INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.??? Synopsis/Solicitation N0017822Q6768 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).? The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation as indicated in the attached SF18.? The SF18 form is being utilized to generate the applicable clauses from the Standard Procurement System.? This requirement is not eligible for small business set-aside. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to procure on a Brand Name or Equal basis for the purchase of Kaydon?s manufactured ball spacers to minimize rotational friction; thin dense chrome plating. Kaydon?s Thin Dense Chrome plating has been characterized for both bearings. Friction characterization data for alternate vendor?s Thin Dense Chrome plating is not currently available for 564772B1 equivalent bearings and using an alternate vendor?s coating would incur risk of degradation to system performance. The equipment must be identical (form, fit, and function) with the equipment already secured. The Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system will be installed on AEGIS ships, meeting the form, fit, and function requirements of the AEGIS system along with the operating system on which the Aegis system executes. The ceramic ball bearings must be compatible in form, fit, and function with each other as well as the existing hardware within the anticipated operating environments for the systems. Utilization of these commercial hardware components has reduced cost and shortened the development schedule for the program by minimizing the amount of engineering to the greatest extent possible. While other vendors sell similar products to Kaydon Bearings that may meet form and fit requirements, they are unable to fulfill function requirements. Procuring bearings thru another vendor other than Kaydon would incur risk to the overall bearing performance, which will adversely affect system level performance. Kaydon bearings are previously tested and currently in fielded systems. The Kaydon Bearings were previously purchased under contract number N0017819P6753 and N0017821P6626. Utilizing an alternate bearings would result in an unanticipated and unbudgeted duplication of costs and an estimated twelve (12) months to redesign, test, develop and field new equipment and processes. In addition, there would be cost impact and a schedule slip to the upcoming ship installation dates. As this has been acknowledged as a Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) project by the Chief, Naval Operations, a slip in the installation dates will be unacceptable. Please include shipping/freight cost to Dahlgren, VA 22448-5114. Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) will be utilized for award in accordance with FAR Part 13.? The order shall be firm fixed price.?? All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.? The completion and submission to the Government of an offer shall indicate the Offeror?s unconditional agreement to the terms and conditions in this solicitation. Offers may be rejected if an exception to the terms or conditions set forth in this solicitation is taken. At time of proposal submission please submit any historical data as well as published pricing.? Quotes will only be accepted from authorized re-sellers who have provided a Letter of Authorization.? Award will be made based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).? Offerors may obtain information on registration in SAM by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Quote is due 09 May 2022, no later than 12:00 p.m. EST with an anticipated award date by 09 June 2022.?

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
