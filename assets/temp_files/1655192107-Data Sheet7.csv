This requirement is mandated by MIL-STD-129P and later and is required under the under the Preservation, Packing and Marking portion of this TDP. 2-12. 85 Percent SHELF-LIFE REMAINING REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO ACQUISITION/PROCUREMENT A. Acquisition/procurement documentation must specify that shelf-life items/material will have not less than 85 percent (allowing for rounding to whole months) of shelf-life remaining at time of receipt by the first Government activity. Any delivery from a contractor not having at least 85 percent shelf-life remaining must normally be considered non-conforming. Refer to Appendix E of this Manual to determine the amount of time that 85% equates to in terms of remaining shelf life for Type I or Type II shelf-life codes. B. In supporting imminent use or consumption, the 85% shelf-life remaining on receipt by first Government activity may be modified or adjusted as deemed prudent at the discretion of PMs and IMMs, when support alternative arrangements such as EC, PV, DVD or local purchase are effected. Use of support alternatives for shipment/delivery to storage facilities as stock will conform to the 85% rule. 2-13. CONTRACTOR MARKING. Shelf life items will be marked for identification and control. Markings, shown below the item identification data are required on all units, intermediate, and exterior packs or unpacked items, must be per MIL STD 129, MIL-STD-130, MIL STD 290 (FSC 9150 only), or FED STD 123, (references (m) through (p)) respectively, and will include the following: A. For Type I shelf life items: apply one, as appropriate; date manufactured, date cured (for elastomeric and rubber products only), date assembled, or date packed (subsistence only); and expiration date. B. For Type II shelf life items: apply one, as appropriate; date manufactured, date cured (for elastomeric and other rubber products only), date assembled, and date packed (subsistence only), and inspect/test date. C. For both Type I and Type II markings in subparagraphs A and B above: the date must be expressed by the numeric month and the last 2 digits of the calendar year; i.e., 06/95, with the day of that month being the last day. D. Different Dates on Identical Items. When two or more unit packs of identical items bear different dates of manufacture, dates of cure, dates of pack, or dates of assembly, the earliest date must be shown on the shipping container. E. For Type I drugs and biologicals: the expiration date only is required. The expiration date should be marked in accordance with FED-SPEC PPP C 186 (reference (q)). Manufacturer date must not be shown for medical items having expiration dates. F.

Description of Requirement Advances in DNA sequencing technology enable scientists to rapidly determine the genomic makeup of various organisms, detect mutations and polymorphisms associated with diseases, define genetic variations of pathogens and their infectivity, reveal patterns of gene expression (transcriptomes), elucidate functions of various RNA species, etc. The extent of achievement relies significantly on the availability of modern DNA sequencers. Scientists in our lab at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) conduct research as well as perform regulatory functions. To meet the needs of DNA sequencing, we use ABI capillary DNA sequencers for sequencing analysis. The number of samples for DNA sequencing in general falls in the range between 60 and 400 per day. To prepare for large number of samples, sequencing reagents such as fluorescent dye (sold as BigDye kit, BDT) and Pop-7 polymer and capillary arrays need to be stocked to avoid supplies shortage. This request is to purchase BigDye kits, Pop-7 polymer, and 24- and 48-capillary arrays, buffers, and plates to be used in capillary DNA sequencing"

The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with Boeing.? The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the Contracting Officer (CO) has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. If Boeing is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, Boeing shall contact the Contracting Officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b). Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the Contracting Officer?s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: ? X? ?Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ? X? ?Calendar Year (CY) The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January ? December).

When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet). When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format. Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. ?Boeing shall provide with its proposal historical Actual Costs Incurred (ACI) data for any similar efforts within the past 3 years. The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; b. contract type; c. contract quantity; d. contract price; and e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)). Note that per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B), modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in FAR 2.101, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial item definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-4) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award. ii. For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2). Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8). Submission of electronic cost model.? The proposal submission shall include an electronic cost model with active formulas demonstrating the mathematical calculation of the proposed cost (in Excel).? The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.? If applicable, the electronic cost model shall link each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to the applicable CLINs.? The electronic cost model shall roll up to an annual and total program summary by cost element.? All information supporting each CLIN should be visible and verifiable in the electronic cost model.?

Attached is the proposal adequacy checklist along with preparation guidelines.? Boeing shall prepare and submit a Cost Analysis Report (CAR) and pricing data for the basic ordering period and each of the option years, and the supporting attachments.? Pricing shall be delivered in accordance with FAR 15.408 Table 15-2.? Additionally, Boeing should provide the following:? a separate cost volume; technical volume which includes approach for production and sustainment requirements; and draft schedule for production and delivery of the first four flight test kits. Proposal Adequacy and Structure. In response to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Boeing shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408.? Further, Boeing shall (1) utilize the DFARS 252.215-7009, Proposal Adequacy Checklist (PAC) (attached to this RFP letter), in pre-submission proposal quality reviews, and (2) furnish the completed checklist as part of its proposal submission. The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with Boeing.? The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the Contracting Officer (CO) has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. If Boeing is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, Boeing shall contact the Contracting Officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b). Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the Contracting Officer?s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: ? X? ?Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ? X? ?Calendar Year (CY) The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January ? December). If the proposal includes more than one CLIN/subCLIN, recurring/non-recurring costs shall be identified for each CLIN/subCLIN. When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet). When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format. Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. ?Boeing shall provide with its proposal historical Actual Costs Incurred (ACI) data for any similar efforts within the past 3 years. The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; b. contract type; c. contract quantity; d. contract price; and e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)). Note that per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B), modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in FAR 2.101, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial item definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-4) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award. ii. For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2). Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8). Submission of electronic cost model.? The proposal submission shall include an electronic cost model with active formulas demonstrating the mathematical calculation of the proposed cost (in Excel).? The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.? If applicable, the electronic cost model shall link each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to the applicable CLINs.? The electronic cost model shall roll up to an annual and total program summary by cost element.? All information supporting each CLIN should be visible and verifiable in the electronic cost model.? The formulas included in the electronic cost model shall not be locked, and the model shall be editable by the Government.

This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside this requirement among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. In the National Airspace System (NAS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) personnel rely on a variety of decision support tools and sources of information to perform their jobs. Controllers use their primary radar displays to monitor air traffic and operational information and make tactical decisions resulting in potential new clearances and information to the aircraft. However, operational personnel often need information in addition to that on their primary display (e.g., radar display, Traffic Situation Display (TSD), oceanic display) to assist in operational situations they encounter. The display of this information is provided through what is generally referred to as Information Display Systems (IDSs). E-IDS will provide an enterprise-level platform that implements, augments and/or replaces the multiple types of IDSs in, or in support of the NAS, including but not limited to En Route, Terminal, Traffic Flow, Oceanic and Offshore domains with common hardware and software. E-IDS will provide displays in over 500 FAA Air Traffic Control facilities and cover approximately 5000 controller positions. The FAA is currently working with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) to select a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) touchscreen display. The selected display will be installed on Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) compatible mounts allowing controllers to adjust and move the screen as needed. In many facilities, the display is located within a short distance from a controller?s head. As a result, the FAA must provide PSE that can be installed on the display to eliminate sharp edges that can lead to head injuries. The FAA is also seeking a solution that provides or incorporates grab handles for easy maneuvering of the display. The FAA will provide specifications for the selected display at a later date, but based on experience and projected needs, the agency intends to implement PSE for a 24-inch display. The PSE must meet the following anticipated minimum requirements: Withstand 24 hours a day, 365 (366 leap year) days a year operation, in an indoor environment. Operate without degradation at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Operate at a relative humidity between 30% - 80% at a temperature range of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Not emit ?out gas? fumes or contain any hazardous materials (e.g., mercury, acetone, asbestos, etc.) Not breakdown when cleaned or handled. Not breakdown due to display heat or exposure to direct sunlight. Be non-porous to prevent absorption of cleaning fluids or body oils. Eliminate sharp edges of the display. Absorb physical impact with users or other equipment. Maintain or increase the physical integrity and stability of the display. Not obstruct any screen area from any angle, either physically or visually. Provide access to the power button, but also obstruct light from the button. Provide access to all buttons (by appropriate personnel), but not expose buttons enough to allow Users to inadvertently turn off the display or change settings unintentionally. Not obstruct access to any of the display?s ports. Not increase the ?remove and replace? time for the display by more than 2 minutes. Not add more than 1 pound of weight to the display. Not add more than 1 inch to height and width of the display. Not obstruct the VESA mount in any way that prevents its use. Provide grab handles, or a sturdy ?grab area? on all 4 sides integrated into the PSE (e.g., recessed area) to accommodate maneuvering of the display. The FAA currently plans to release a Screening Information Request/Request for Proposal (SIR/RFP). At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do an unrestricted competition, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a suitable COTS product, or a vendor-designed and produced display PSE, meeting the minimum requirements above. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 339113. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: Submission of a capability statement that clearly demonstrates: (a) the administrative and technical skills and experience required to fully comply with the requirements of this effort; and (b) the ability to work successfully within the FAA infrastructure in complying with the safety, security, and operational requirements contained in FAA Orders and Advisory Circulars for performance of duties on airport property or within the confines of secured FAA facilities. Responses must be submitted on company letterhead, in a type font no less than 12 point and shall not exceed 10 pages in total length.

Day meeting will be held on May 11, 2022 from 10:30 am to 5:00 pm EDT to introduce the SMART ePANTS program to potential proposers and to provide information on technical requirements and program objectives. To attend the event, participants must register (https://www.client-meeting.net/smart-epants-conference/) prior to Tuesday May 10, 2022 at 12 PM EDT. Same day registrations will not be accepted. Overview: The IARPA SMART ePANTS program aims to develop sensor systems that can record and store audio, video and location data. For maximum comfort and dexterity of the user, additional program objectives include sensor integration into clothing, where the garment maintains similar stretchability, bendability, surface roughness and washability attributes to a comparable garment containing no sensor. SMART ePANTS sensor systems must also be safely worn against the skin, be reusable, and be capable of exporting the data they gather to an external data storage device (such as a computer hard drive). Sensor systems will be entirely incorporated into garment components, especially fibers, yarn and fabric, but may include (to a limited extent) expected commercial (i.e., currently available for sale) garment accessories such as buttons, grommets, zippers, piping or collar stays. *****PLEASE REVIEW ATTACHED 'SMART ePANTS Proposers Day Announcement' DOCUMENT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS*****"

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices. Submitted documents shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. Proposal Contents: COVER LETTER - Shall not exceed 2 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: AOI for which proposal is submitted (number and title) Company name, physical address, mailing address, and website URL Note: CSO is a streamlined acquisition process -- The Government intends to evaluate proposals on a rolling basis up until 9 Sep 2022, and as applicable, execute awards NLT 48 hours after receipt of proposals.

SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ?

This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Short-lived radioisotopes are important for any application aiming to limit a radiological dose. Most radiopharmaceuticals have half-lives of several days as the time required between production, separation, drug incorporation, and delivery to the patient can take several days to a week. INL?s technology would accelerate this process by producing the isotopes on-demand at the point of use. By introducing a fast separation method, the total isotope preparation time would be reduced drastically to only ~1-2 hours. Description:?? ?INL?s technology utilizes nuclear instrumentation and a modular rapid chemical separation system developed at INL to produce ultra-short-lived radionuclides such as Ta-185, in-house and on-demand. The key features of the method are production of Ta-185 via irradiation of W-186 with a linear accelerator, an optimized irradiation method for maximum Ta-185 production and rapid chemical separation technique utilizing a stream-lined rapid chromatographic isotope separation system (S-RCISS) to quickly separate and isolate Ta-185. Benefits:??? ?????? Novel separation system drastically surpassing rapidity of current systems. The rapid separation allows on-site and on-demand production of radioisotopes. ? Applications:?? Radioisotope applications. Opens up a new market for ultra-short-lived radioisotope applications. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is an early-stage concept and needs further testing. IP Status: ??????? Provisional Patent Application No. 63/203,858, ?Methods for Producing Radionuclides Using Accelerator Bremsstrahlung Irradiation and Rapid Chromatographic Isotope Separation,? BEA Docket No. 1252 Additional Information INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities. Please visit Technology Deployment?s website at https://inl.gov/inl-initiatives/technology-deployment for more information on working with INL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process."

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.??? Synopsis/Solicitation N0017822Q6768 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).? The synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Regulation as indicated in the attached SF18.? The SF18 form is being utilized to generate the applicable clauses from the Standard Procurement System.? This requirement is not eligible for small business set-aside. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), intends to procure on a Brand Name or Equal basis for the purchase of Kaydon?s manufactured ball spacers to minimize rotational friction; thin dense chrome plating. Kaydon?s Thin Dense Chrome plating has been characterized for both bearings. Friction characterization data for alternate vendor?s Thin Dense Chrome plating is not currently available for 564772B1 equivalent bearings and using an alternate vendor?s coating would incur risk of degradation to system performance. The equipment must be identical (form, fit, and function) with the equipment already secured. The Optical Dazzling Interdictor, Navy (ODIN) system will be installed on AEGIS ships, meeting the form, fit, and function requirements of the AEGIS system along with the operating system on which the Aegis system executes. The ceramic ball bearings must be compatible in form, fit, and function with each other as well as the existing hardware within the anticipated operating environments for the systems. Utilization of these commercial hardware components has reduced cost and shortened the development schedule for the program by minimizing the amount of engineering to the greatest extent possible. While other vendors sell similar products to Kaydon Bearings that may meet form and fit requirements, they are unable to fulfill function requirements. Procuring bearings thru another vendor other than Kaydon would incur risk to the overall bearing performance, which will adversely affect system level performance. Kaydon bearings are previously tested and currently in fielded systems. The Kaydon Bearings were previously purchased under contract number N0017819P6753 and N0017821P6626. Utilizing an alternate bearings would result in an unanticipated and unbudgeted duplication of costs and an estimated twelve (12) months to redesign, test, develop and field new equipment and processes. In addition, there would be cost impact and a schedule slip to the upcoming ship installation dates. As this has been acknowledged as a Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) project by the Chief, Naval Operations, a slip in the installation dates will be unacceptable. Please include shipping/freight cost to Dahlgren, VA 22448-5114. Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) will be utilized for award in accordance with FAR Part 13.? The order shall be firm fixed price.?? All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.? The completion and submission to the Government of an offer shall indicate the Offeror?s unconditional agreement to the terms and conditions in this solicitation. Offers may be rejected if an exception to the terms or conditions set forth in this solicitation is taken. At time of proposal submission please submit any historical data as well as published pricing.? Quotes will only be accepted from authorized re-sellers who have provided a Letter of Authorization.? Award will be made based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. In order to be eligible for award, firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).? Offerors may obtain information on registration in SAM by calling 866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Quote is due 09 May 2022, no later than 12:00 p.m. EST with an anticipated award date by 09 June 2022.?

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract wards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was stablished to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under his informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed."

1. Project Name
Contact Center System 

2. Purpose 
The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT), through its Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division (DMV), is interested in learning about Contact Center systems that could improve services for its customers using a central point where it can manage all customer interactions across various channels. This will help increase productivity, provide necessary reports, and have all needed functionality within one system.

3. High-Level Description of the Current System 
Vendors are not asked to duplicate or imitate the systems or workflows currently used at DMV. This is provided as background information and DMV is receptive to advantageous changes to serve its customers and assist with internal managing of the call centers.

High-Level Description of the Systems Currently In Use: 

1) The current phone system that DMV uses to receive incoming and outgoing calls is Unify.
2) DMV has three call centers, two of which are located within a secured, restricted environment. 
a. The firewalls for these call centers are secured by Oregon DMV and Oregon Department of Corrections. 
2) DMV uses IBM Artificial Intelligence Interactive Voice Response and Webchat system called Watson to allow customers to communicate with computers and provide answers and links to the website to help answer basic questions. 
3) Call center agents use Unify desk phones or soft phones.
4) DMV uses Atos Unify OpenScape Voice for call routing and tracking.
5) DMV call center has a total of 21 queue lines that come in from 30 different phone numbers.
6) DMV uses ASC INSPIRATIONneo for 100% of call recordings, 20% of which also have screen recordings during the call. Call recordings include a 1-year retention.

When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 3.4.1 NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG. 3.4.2 NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG - Manufacture of this item requires vendor certification in accordance with NAVSEA S9320-AM-PRO-020/MLDG. 3.4.3 ;IAW 6873683 rev ""B"" note 4.

Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.4.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.5 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ANTENNA CONTROL GRP furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;53711 7649065; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government.

The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The ANTENNA CONTROL GRP furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;53711 7649065; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 4.2.1 ;Suppliers currently using and maintaining Inspection System Requirements to MIL-I-45208 are granted permission to utilize this if desired.; 4.3 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.4 Records of Inspection - (This requirement is not applicable to Government Purchase Orders) Records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor, as referenced elsewhere in this contract, shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of four years after final delivery of supplies. 5.

The Government is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, cost, and functionality of Information Technology (IT) tools, applications or products capable of satisfying the life-cycle technical, functional, operational, and/or capabilities described in this RFI. Any information submitted by respondents to this request is strictly voluntary.? This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach.? The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses from this RFI or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the use of such information.? All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and market research purposes only.? To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information.? Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.? The Government shall not be liable for damages related to proprietary information that is not properly identified.? Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.? BACKGROUND: Future Special Operations may be conducted in complex, shallow-water, cluttered littoral environments.? Communication, understanding and reacting to threats that pose significant risk to the warfighter and other assets is critical to mission success. ?As enhanced resources are deployed, underwater communication devices that provide greater situational awareness are paramount to minimize risk and accomplish the mission. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) is seeking white papers from industry, academia, individuals and government organizations capable of providing research, design, and testing of the objectives described below. The Goal of this RFI is to research, discover and evaluate technologies that will accelerate the delivery of advanced capabilities to enhance communications and that will provide an asymmetrical warfare advantage during Diving operations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on best practices, technology solutions and cost estimates for Underwater Diver communication modular payloads and enhancements specific to the two objectives stated below. ?NUWCDIVNPT is interested in information for the following objectives. Objective 1: Investigate Diver communication payloads that can be integrated and worn by a diver, to facilitate and enhance reliable communications between divers which can include diver to diver, and diver to platform communication.? The communication technology must be able to be worn by a diver, portable, maximize Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) and if possible provide ease of operation switching from underwater environment to shore. ?It is desired for the proposed capabilities to achieve maximum situational awareness from the smallest possible devices to improve decision making across multiple communication modalities.? The ability of the Diver to effectively communicate between divers is paramount as is the capability to establish communications between multiple deployed communication systems in the operational environment. Objective 2: Investigate commercial or developmental underwater communication capability enhancements that will result in increased Diver capabilities and positional/placement accuracy and enhanced situational awareness.? The ease with which these capability enhancements are compatible and can be integrated into commercial or other government underwater network is of interest.? Submittals that suggest a developmental technology, vehicle or other method to deliver the enhanced communications from an underwater platform will be accepted and reviewed in the study. ?Vulnerability to the diver and of the underwater capability should be provided as well. REQUESTED INFORMATION: The government is seeking white papers on the objectives stated above.? White papers can address either objective, or both of the objectives.?

Under North American Industry Classification System Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications. Closing Date for RFI: 10 June 2022 at 11 am, local time, Quantico, Virginia THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) OR PROPOSAL (RFP). This RFI is a market research tool, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, to determine the availability and adequacy of potential solutions prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a RFP. The Government will not reimburse for any information received from potential sources in response to this RFI. Any costs incurred responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent?s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition. This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive or sole source contract.? 2. BACKGROUND The MCSC has an Approved Acquisition Objective to procure 111 MSAT systems beginning in or around Fiscal Year 24. The MSAT provides Marine forces assured SATCOM capabilities for operation through anticipated contested electronic warfare environments of near-peer and nation-state competitors. The system must be man-portable to support Expeditionary Advanced Based Operation and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment that have the distinctive operational characteristic of employing small, highly dispersed, and mobile teams. The MSAT will operate through SHF denied environments. It will provide technologies to mitigate jamming of its communications circuits. Additionally, it will provide technologies that limit the detection and monitoring of emissions. The size, weight, and power consumption of the system will be optimized for a system transit footprint of two cases (or less) that are each man-portable and fit in a commercial aircraft cabin overhead storage bin. The ultimate objective would be for a system that is man-packable in a single backpack. MSAT should support information throughputs of 8 Mbps or less. 3. DESCRIPTION Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Portfolio Manager, Command Element Systems, Program Manager Communications Systems, Product Manager Satellite Communications (SATCOM) seeks industry feedback and information on specific industry capabilities for a SATCOM Man-Portable Secure Anti-Jam Terminal (MSAT) solution. Feedback gathered from this effort will be compiled and used to refine the solicitation for a potential contracting effort in the future. The MSAT is a system within the Marine Corps Wideband Satellite Communications Family of Systems that provides deployed Marine forces operational capabilities to both maintain Command and Control of current and future dispersed operational units and to access Defense Information Systems Network services. The MSAT will provide assured broadband communications for units in environments where normal Super High Frequency (SHF) communications (military and civilian) are degraded or denied. A degraded or denied environment is defined as existing when an adversary uses active measures to disrupt normal satellite communications.? 4. RESPONSE REQUESTED The purpose of this RFI is to provide Marine Corps decision makers with a better understanding of existing systems and technologies for MSAT design and development. Responses may leverage existing military systems (e.g., Advanced Extremely High Frequency, Evolved Strategic SATCOM) or commercial systems. The Government requests respondents provide comments on the questions outlined below. Responses shall be limited to 15 pages or less. The Marine Corps is requesting the following information: Identify existing technologies and operational approaches to communicating in a denied or degraded environment. Identify off the shelf technologies and products that could provide the capabilities identified in (1) for MSAT. Identify the likelihood of systems identified in (2) to meet MSAT portability objectives for in-transit size and weight, and data throughput.

RESPONSE DATE This announcement will remain open through the response date indicated or until extended or replaced by a successor BAA. White Papers may be submitted any time during this period. 4. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION 4.1 SUMMARY NAVSEA, on behalf of the Electric Ships Office (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office Ships) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in current and future shipboard electric power and energy systems at the major component, subsystem and system level. The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship power systems to the Navy by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy, industry, and academia investments. PMS 320 will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships. 4.2 NAVAL POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP Naval power and energy systems are described in detail in the 2019 Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (NPES TDR). The NPES TDR focuses and aligns the power system investments for the Navy, Defense Department, industry and academia to guide future research and development investments to enable the Navy to leverage these investments to meet its future needs more affordably. Included in the NPES TDR are specific recommendations and opportunities for near, mid and long term investments, with a renewed focus on energy management. These opportunities range from an energy magazine to support advanced weapons and sensors to the development of an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES). The NPES TDR aligns electric power system developments with war fighter needs and enables capability-based budgeting. The NPES TDR is responding to the emerging needs of the Navy, and while the plan is specific in its recommendations, it is inherently flexible enough to adapt to the changing requirements and threats that may influence the 30-year ship acquisition plan. The first section of the roadmap establishes why NPES are a critical part of the kill chain based on the capabilities desired by the Navy in the near term, as well as supporting future platforms in the Navys 30-year shipbuilding plan. The second section of the roadmap presents power and energy requirements that are derived from mission systems necessary to support future warfighting needs. The third section describes required initiatives based on capabilities and the projected electrical requirements of the future ships. 4.3 FOCUS AREAS The areas of focus for this BAA include, but are not limited to, the ""FYDP/NEAR-TERM"" activities as described throughout the NPES TDR; the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard (both manned and unmanned) electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, electric propulsion, power conversion, energy storage, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system and component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; and power system simplicity, upgradeability, flexibility, and ruggedness. The Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them. For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management). For ship service electrical loads, the architecture includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application. Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency, power density improvements and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies. The NPES TDR partitions the power system in to functional areas that include the following. 4.3.1 ENERGY STORAGE Energy storage modules may support short duration to long duration energy storage applications, which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system. For the short duration energy storage applications, the module should provide hold-up power to uninterruptible loads for fault clearing and transient isolation, as well as load leveling for pulse power loads. For the mid duration, the module should provide up to approximately 3MW (100 - 150 kW-hr) of standby power for pulse power loads while also providing continuity of operations for a subset of equipment between uninterruptible and full ships load (including emergency power generation starting in a dark ship condition). For long duration applications, energy storage modules should provide the required power as an emergency backup system or to provide increased stealth for specialty equipment. The required duration for this type of application may extend up to days or longer, and may be intermittent or continuous. A number of energy storage technologies for future ship applications are of interest to the Navy, including various electrochemical, capacitor-based, or rotating discussed below: a. Capacitor: Electrochemical capacitor improvements continue to focus on improving energy density while maintaining inherently high-power density. Design improvements include development and integration of higher temperature films, advanced electrolytes, advanced electrode materials, and minimizing equivalent series resistance (ESR). b. Rotating: The Navy has interest in the investment from the transportation industry in flywheel systems that can handle gyroscopic forces continues to support flywheel usage in commercial rail and ground transportation. Additional factors of interest to the Navy include safety, recharge/discharge rates, ship motion impacts, environmental impacts and control. c. Electrochemical: Factors of interest to the Navy with respect to electrochemical energy storage include the ability to maintain state of charge when not in use; change in voltage versus state of charge; charge and discharge capability; the temporary or permanent loss of capacity due to repeated shallow discharges; the ability to shallow charge and discharge or partially charge intermittently during a discharge; battery life considerations such as service-life, cycle life, and shelf-life; off-gas properties that affect the level of ventilation and associated auxiliary systems; and safety enhancements to support qualification for use onboard US Navy ships. Near term Navy interests are in the area of common and scalable hardware and software elements which enable advanced weapons and sensors and in understanding the sizing algorithms for how to optimize energy storage sizing against various competing system requirements (short duration/high power vs. long duration/low power, for example. The specific design issues to be considered include reliability, volumetric and gravimetric power and energy densities, differentiating between high levels of stored energy and high energy density. The relevant information required for characterizing technology performance include: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of components and systems; production capability; safety evaluation and qualifications performed on relevant subsystems or components (any hazard analyses of systems designs as relevant to notional applications); other military application of the devices; energy storage management system approach; thermal characteristics, constraints, and cooling requirements; auxiliary requirements (load); device impedance (heat generation characteristics); and device efficiency (discharge/recharge). 4.3.2 POWER CONVERSION Industry continues to drive towards increased power density, increased efficiency, higher switching frequencies, and refined topologies with associated control schemes. Innovation in power conversion from the development and implementation of wide-bandgap devices, such as Silicon Carbide (SiC), promise reduction in losses many times over Silicon. The use of high frequency transformers can provide galvanic isolation with reduced size and weight compared to traditional transformers. Advances in cooling methods will be required to handle larger heat loads associated with higher power operation. A typical Navy power conversion module might consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer. Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, are of particular interest. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to address converting high voltage AC/DC to 1000 VDC with power levels on the order of 3MW or larger. The specific design issues to be considered include modularity, open architecture (focusing on future power system flexibility and the ability of a conversion module within a ships power system to be replaced/ upgraded in support of lifecycle mission system upgrades), reliability, cost, and conversion efficiency. Areas of interest include more power-dense converters supporting advanced mission systems and prototyping of full scale conversion based on second generation wide-bandgap devices. 4.3.3 POWER DISTRIBUTION Power distribution typically consists of bus duct/ bus pipe, cables, connections, switchgear and fault protection equipment, load centers, and other hardware necessary to deliver power from generators to loads. Industry has used medium voltage DC (MVDC) transmission as a method to reduce losses across long distances. Complementarily, Industry is developing MVDC circuit protection for use in MVDC transmission variants of approximately 50, 100, and 150 megawatts (MW) at transmission voltages of 20 to 50 kVDC. Analysis includes modeling and simulation to determine methods for assessing the benefits of DC vs AC undersea transmission and distribution systems for offshore oil and gas. Industry and academia continue to invest resources in advanced conductors that have applications in power distribution, power generation, and propulsion. Research is focused on using carbon nanotubes. The development of a room temperature, lightweight, low resistance conductor is of great interest to the Navy. Areas of interest include development of an MVDC distribution system up to 12 kVDC to meet maximum load demands; design of an appropriate in-zone distribution system architecture; development of high speed 1 kVDC and 12 kVDC solid state circuit protection devices that are ship ready, and advanced conductors capable of supporting power distribution. 4.3.4 PRIME MOVERS (INCLUDING POWER GENERATION) Power Generation converts fuel into electrical power. A typical power generation module might consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine (prime mover), a generator (see rotating machine discussion below), a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible power generation technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts. Power generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive. NPES DC technologies permit prime movers and other electrical sources (such as energy storage) to operate at different, non-60Hz electrical frequency speeds, improving survivability, resiliency, and operational availability. Energy storage that is fully integrated with the power generation can enable uninterrupted power to high priority loads, mission systems that reduce susceptibility, and damage control systems to enable enhanced recoverability. The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, module level power density, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, system grounding approaches, fault protection, response to large dynamic (step) or pulse type loading originated from ship propulsion or directed energy/electromagnetic weapons, interface to main or ship service bus, autonomy, limited maintenance, and commercial availability. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to power generation in the 5 to 30 MW range, utilizing gas turbines, diesel engines and other emerging power technologies that address challenges associated with achieving reduced fuel consumption, decreased life cycle and acquisition cost, support of ship integration, enable flexibility, enable power upgrades, and improved environmental compliance. Near term Navy interest includes 10-30 MW (nominally 25 MW) output power rating and the power generation source able to supply two independent electrical buses (where abnormal conditions, including pulsed/stochastic loads, on one bus do not impact the other bus) at 12 kVDC (while also considering 6kVDC, 18kVDC, and 1 kVDC). Enhanced fuel injection, higher operating temperatures and pressures, and optimized thermal management are critical for future prime movers. Advanced controls for increased efficiency, reduced maintenance, and increased reliability include implementation of digital controls; autonomous and unmanned power control; enhanced engine monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics; and distributed controls. Advanced designs for increased efficiency include new applications of thermodynamic cycles such as Humphrey/Atkinson cycle for gas turbines and diesels and Miller cycle for diesel. The Navy is interested in developing a knowledge bank of information on potential generator sets, generator electrical interface requirements, and the impacts of those requirements on generator set performance and size, as a logical next step from the Request for Information released under announcement N00024-16-R-4205. A long-term goal for this effort is to maximize military effectiveness through design choice and configuration option flexibility when developing next-generation distribution plants. The power generation source should fit within the length of a typical engine room (46 feet, including allowances for any needed maintenance and component removal). The power generation source is expected to have the ability to: control steady-state voltage-current characteristic for its interface; to maintain stability; and to adjust control set-points from system level controllers. For any proposed design approach, initial efforts would include conceptual design trade studies that inform the performance level that can be achieved. Trade studies may address Pulsed Load Capability (generator/rectifier design to increase pulse load capability, engine speed variation limits, and impact of cyclic pulse load on component life); Power Density (cost vs. benefits of high speed or high frequency, mounting on common skid, and advanced cooling concepts); Single vs. Dual Outputs (continuous vs. pulse rating for each output, voltage regulation with shared field, and control of load sharing); Efficiency (part load vs. full load optimization, flexible speed regulation, impact of intake and exhaust duct size/pressure drop on engine efficiency); Power Quality (voltage transient, voltage modulation for step, pulse loads, impact of voltage and current ripple requirements, and common mode current); PGM Controls (prime mover speed vs. generator field vs. rectifier active phase angle control, and pulse anticipation); Stability when operating in parallel with other sources; Short Circuit Requirements; and Dark Ship start capability (self-contained support auxiliaries). Trade studies may also address how rotational energy storage can be built into the design of the generator or added to the generator and what parameters need to be defined in order to exploit this capability. Development of advanced coatings and materials that support high temperature operations of a gas turbine is also of interest. Energy harvesting to convert heat energy and specifically low quality heat energy to electricity using solid state components is also of interest to the Navy. 4.3.5 ROTATING MACHINES (INCLUDING GENERATORS AND PROPULSION MOTORS) Recent trends in electrical machines include neural networks; artificial intelligence; expert system; fiber communications and integrated electronics; new ceramic conducting and dielectric materials; and magnetic levitation. High Temperature Superconducting rotors have higher power density than their induction and synchronous rotor counterparts. Wind power generators eliminate excitation losses which can account for 30% of total generator losses. The offshore wind power industry is moving to larger power wind tower generators in the 10MW class. Advanced low resistance room temperature wire and HTS shows promise for these higher power levels because of low excitation losses and low weight due to reduction in stator and rotor iron. HTS motors may be up to 50% smaller and lighter than traditional iron-core and copper machines. They have reduced harmonic vibrations due to minimization of flux path iron and have mitigated thermal cycling failures due to precision control of temperature. Propulsion motor concepts of interest to the Navy include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC). The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, thermal management, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints. Motor drives that may be explored include cyclo-converter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type). Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate as a motor and a generator to facilitate a PDSS installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed. Areas of interest for future rotating machines include increased magnetic material flux carrying or flux generation capacity; improved electrical insulation material and insulation system dielectric strength; increased mechanical strength, increased thermal conductivity, and reduced sensitivity to temperature; improved structural materials and design concepts that accept higher torsional and electromagnetically induced stress; innovative and aggressive cooling to allow improved thermal management and increased current loading; increased electrical conductor current carrying capacity and loss reduction. 4.3.6 COOLING AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT As the demand and complexity of high energy loads increases, so does the demand and complexity of thermal management solutions. Assessing and optimizing the effectiveness of a thermal management system requires the analysis of thermal energy acquisition, thermal energy transport, and thermal energy rejection, storage, and conversion. The design of the thermal management system aims to transfer the thermal energy loads at the sources to the sinks in the most efficient manner. Areas of interest to the Navy with respect to cooling and thermal management include the application of two phased cooling and other advanced cooling techniques to power electronics and other NPES components and innovative approaches to manage overall ship thermal management issues including advanced thermal architectures, thermal energy storage systems, increases in efficiency, and advanced control philosophies. 4.3.7 POWER CONTROLS Controls manage power and energy flow within the ship to ensure delivery to the right load in the right form at the right time. Supervisory power system control typically resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore does not include hardware elements unless specialized hardware is required. The challenge to implement Tactical Energy Management (TEM) is to integrate energy storage, power generation, and interfaces with advanced warfighting systems and controls. TEM is critical to enabling full utilization of the capabilities possible from technologies under development. The state complexity and combat engagement timelines for notional future warfighting scenarios are expected to exceed the cognitive capacity and response times of human operators to effectively manage the electric plant via existing control system schema in support of executing ship missions. The survivability requirements for military ships combined with the higher dynamic power characterisitics (pulse load) characteristics of some mission systems will require more sophisticated control interfaces, power management approaches, and algorithms than are commercially available. The Navy is pursuing a long term strategy to create a unified, cyber secure architecture for machinery control systems that feature a common, reusable, cyber hardened machinery control domain specific infrastructure elements; a mechanism for transitioning new technology from a variety of sources in an efficient and consistent manner; and a mechanism to provide life cycle updates and support in a cost effective and timely manner.?TEM controls will be expected to maintain awareness of the electric plant operating state (real time modeling); interface with ship mission planning (external to the electric plant control systems) for energy resource prioritization, planning, and coordination towards the identification of resource allocation states that dynamically optimize mission effectiveness; identify and select optimal trajectories to achieving those optimal resource allocation states; and actuate the relevant electric plant components to move the electric plant state along those optimized trajectories towards the optimal resource allocation state. TEM controls would enable reduced power and energy system resource requirements for a given capability (or improved capability for a given set of resources); increased adaptability of the Navy?s power and energy system design to keep pace with an evolving threat environment; and maximized abilities to execute the ship?s mission. The Navy is interested in potential applications of distributed control architectures that have led to the development of intelligent agents that have some autonomous ability to reason about system state and enact appropriate control policies. A simple example of these agents in a control system is the use of autonomous software coupled with smart meters in a smart grid implementation. The agents, smart meters in this example, can temporarily shut off air conditioning but not the refrigerator in residences during grid peak power usage times when the cost per watt is highest on hot days. The agent software acts autonomously within its authority to comply with programmed customer desires. The Navy is interested in TEM controls within a modular open systems architecture framework such that they are agnostic of, but affordably customizable to, specific ship platforms and power system architectures.? TEM controls may reside between (i.e. interface with) embedded layers within individual power system components, ships? supervisory machinery control systems, and ships? mission planning systems. Initial or further development or modification of these interfaces may be required to achieve desired performance behaviors and characteristics. TEM controls are expected to develop within a model-based system engineering and digital engineering environment and will be initially evaluated in a purely computational environment, representing Navy-developed shipboard-representative power and energy system architecture(s), but will be progressively evaluated on systems with increasing levels of physical instantiation (i.e., controller-hardware-in-loop and power-hardware-in-loop with progressive levels of representative power system components physically instantiated). When implementing a TEM based control scheme, the overall power system should increase installed power generation available to mission and auxiliary loads; reduce power system design margins; hone the installed stored energy required for mission critical capability; and allow higher power transients (ramp rates and step loads). Other areas of interest to the Navy with respect to controls include improvements to traditional machinery control and automation, advanced power management, cyber security, and advanced controls for distributed shared energy storage and maintaining electrical system stability. The Navy is also interested in non-intrusive load monitoring, power system data analytics, real time system monitoring and onboard analysis and diagnostics capabilities. 4.3.8 SYSTEM INTERPLAY, INTERFACING, AND INTEGRATION Increasingly, the Navy is recognizing the need for incorporating flexibility and adaptability into initial ship designs and recognizing that the integration of new systems and the ability to rapidly reconfigure them will be an ongoing challenge throughout a platform's life cycle in order to maintain warfighting relevancy. The ability to support advanced electrical payload warfighting technologies requires not only power and energy systems delivered with the flexibility and adaptability to accommodate them, but a NPES engineering enterprise with the capability and capacity (knowledge, labor, and capital) for continuous systems integration. The Navy can more affordably meet this challenge by shifting as much effort as possible into the computational modeling and simulation regime. An Integrated Power System (IPS) provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, energy storage, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system. Adding Energy Storage and advanced controls to IPS results in an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) in order to accommodate future high energy weapons and sensors. The IPES Energy Magazine is available to multiple users, and provides enhanced power continuity to the power distribution system. The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ships mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC). Systems engineering in IPS/IPES is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types (both manned and unmanned) and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy-controlled. IPES offers the potential to reduce signatures by changing the frequency and amplitude of acoustic and electromagnetic emissions. Integrated energy storage can reduce observability by enabling the reduction and elimination of prime movers, thereby reducing thermal and acoustic signatures. The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to new construction and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness. Areas of Navy interest are to continuously improve IPS/IPES by performing analysis, modeling and simulation..."
