Completion of this process will allow your business to participate in future County business opportunities.  It also provides your ability to maintain your data as your business grows or changes.  There is a two-step process to register as a vendor; one for bidding opportunities and a second to set your company up to receive purchase orders and payment.  So, bear with us as we help open the window of opportunity for you.

The first step is to get set you up to receive electronic bid notifications.  The County utilizes the services of Public Purchase, a third-party electronic bidding software that allows vendors to register for specific goods and services they offer.  This would be done using NIGP (National Institution of Governmental Purchasing) codes as the commodity part number.  Once you are registered with Public Purchase, you will receive e-mail notifications of upcoming bidding opportunities for the items you signed up for.  You will also be able to view all the open bids, electronically respond to the bids and see bid results once they are awarded.  Additionally, you would receive notices of any addendums to those bids as well as have the opportunity to post questions and receive answers pertaining to that bid.  All questions and answers are posted on-line so that all bidders have access to the same information regarding the bid.

There is NO CHARGE to register and utilize this service for the County of Riverside.  Public Purchase has other services available for a fee, but that is solely at your discretion and not required to do business with the County of Riverside."

A current list of such Excluded States and Outlying Areas is maintained at https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/contractors/ End of Update Process for Contractor Entry into FAA Facilities I.? Effective Date This COVID-19 attestation process is effective immediately. II.? Definitions A.? Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Facility or Operational Location: Workspace for which FAA has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, requisition, or condemnation. B.? Contractor: Firms/entities providing services and/or supplies to FAA under a Federal contract award. C.? Contractor Employees: Individual employees of the contractor entity performing work under a FAA contract award. D.? On-Site: Physically being present at a FAA facility or operational location. III.? Background The FAA has updated its current operating procedures in response to the updated Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Guidance and the July 29, 2021 guidance issued by the Administration?s Safer Workforce Task Force concerning COVID-19 Workplace Safety: Agency Model Safety Principles (https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov). The country is still in the midst of a global pandemic and therefore, Government-wide guidance continues to evolve, including recently issued guidance regarding enhanced mask wearing and testing for Federal employees, on-site contractors, and visitors. To this end, it is still highly encouraged that any contractor employee who can perform their work on a contract in support of the Department without negative impact to the mission, be afforded the flexibility to telework to the maximum extent practicable. While it is understood that many contractors must perform work at FAA facilities, compliance with the new guidance and any future changes may be required. IV.? Authorities A.?Executive Order (EO) No. 13991 ? Protecting the Federal Workforce and Requiring Mask Wearing, January 20, 2021 B.??Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memo No. M-21-15 ? COVID-19 Safe Federal workplace: Agency Model Safety Principles, January 24, 2021 C.??OMB Memo No. M-21-25 ? Integrating Planning for a Safe Increased Return of Federal Employees and Contractors to Physical Workplaces with Post-Reentry Personnel Policies and work Environment, June 10, 2021 V.? Policy and Procedures 1.? Using the OMB-approved Certification of Vaccination Form?(https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/CertificationVaccinationPRAv7.pdf), contractor employees who are scheduled to report to FAA facilities shall attest to their employer as to their vaccination status. Using the information provided by individual employees, contractor firms shall attest to the vaccination status of their employees who will be physically on-site at a FAA facility. Contractor firms must communicate to their assigned FAA Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR) that all of their contractor employees reporting to FAA facilities are following this guidance and are either vaccinated or are testing as specified below. On-site contractor employees who are not fully vaccinated or who decline to provide their vaccination status to their employer are required to obtain a negative COVID-19 test no older than 72 hours to enter FAA facilities. Under either scenario, FAA CORs will rely on the attestation of the contractor firm. Testing requirements only affect on-site contractor personnel who are unvaccinated or who decline to provide their vaccination status. CORs shall not collect or store information on the vaccination status of any individual contractor employee. That is the responsibility of the contractor firm. 2.? On-site contractor employees shall also follow all signage posted in FAA facilities or operational locations regarding masking and comply with all instructions/requirements by Federal Protective Service officers and/or facility managers. Failure to comply with signage and local facility requirements will result in removal from the facility. While localized facility guidance takes precedence, individuals can monitor areas of high transmission via the CDC COVID-19 Data Tracker County View (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view). 3.? Contractor personnel should carry their completed OMB-approved Certification of Vaccination form and/or current negative COVID test results with them at all times when at a FAA facility or operational location and be prepared to show those documents to any security guard or other government official if asked. The government will not retain any of the contractor forms. VI.? Questions Any questions or concerns not addressed in the online FAQ or concerns regarding this Directive shall be submitted to 9-AFN-ACQ-EM@faa.gov."
