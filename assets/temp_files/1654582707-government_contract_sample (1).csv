Interested parties will provide industry solutions for inspection of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?) in a marine environment. Many commercial off the shelf (COTS) products in the industries of sewer, heat exchanger, and pipe manufacturing inspection fulfill most but not all of the desired requirements. ? Interested companies with the technologies capable of meeting the desired general requirements may submit responses that include products current and expected capabilities with modifications. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will reimburse no costs associated with response to this RFI. B.?? ?BACKGROUND The US Navy is seeking information on the industry capabilities for inspection system of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?). ?This pipe will be referred to as a guide or stowage tube, and is part of a system that a Towed Array travels through on deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection systems major components would consist of a user control system, inspection device, and cable storage. ?This system would need to be portable so it could be deployed and setup pier side to access the entry point on the vessel. ?Power would be provided by a battery and/or use standard 120 VAC 60Hz power. ?The maximum working length needed to inspect a guide or stowage tube will account for distance from system user control station to entry of guide or stowage tube. ?Diver support would be used to assist the inspection effort and access the guide or stowage tube entry point. ?Due to limitations of access, an inspection device using internal sensors is preferred, as clearance for external sensors is limited. ?Along the inspection run, the inspection device must traverse a minimum bend radius. ?These bend radius sections are through roller box assemblies, which consist of rollers made of Delrin, which reduce friction through these turns during deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection device would need to be waterproof and operate in a marine environment (regular immersion in salt water). ?This desired inspection device must be able to provide visual and measurement data of reasonable resolution in real time via a user control station and save this data for post analysis using a removable storage device. ?Accurate measurement would be expected for the following conditions of the stowage or guide tube: ?submerged in saltwater, partially submerged, or empty. ?Data collection is expected to be completed in a work day (8-12 Hrs.), for the required length of guide or stowage tube. ?The systems provided software program can be used to view visual and measurement data in real time. ?The location of the inspection device would be tracked and used to mark locations of interest for post analysis. ?This program could also be used to export data to commonly available software using removable storage media. ?For post analysis, standalone PC software is used to analyze ?raw? data from inspection system to generate a CAD file or inspection report. The small diameter pipe is part of either a Thinline or Fatline Towed Array Handling System (TAHS). ?Where the pipe is referred to as a guide tube in a Thinline system, and stowage tube in a Fatline system. ?The primary differences between these two systems is working length, pipe diameter, minimum bend radius, and presence of roller boxes. ?Requirements will be separated for inspection of each handing system, however there is interest in an inspection system capable of meeting the combined requirements of each handling system. Authorized personnel will provide feedback and any technical data necessary to facilitate responses on industry capabilities. C.?? ?REQUIREMENTS The following are the requirements of the inspection system: ? See Attached Thinline Guide Tube Inspection Requirements See Attached Fatline Stowage Tube Inspection Requirements 1. Thinline Towed Array Handling System: Measure Pipe Size: 2.00 in. Nominal Diameter Min. Bend Radius: 4 ft. Travel Through Roller Boxes: YES Max. Device Size: 1.45 in.

"Trades and Subcontracts: HVAC, Refrigeration, Mechanical Bids",WA,SMALL DIAMETER PIPE INSPECTION,Federal,,Department of Defense,12-05-2022,Department of Defense,https://sam.gov/opp/f216bc370cde47978c52a716454172f6/view,RFISS-46,Purchasing,,703-695-7145,eric.e.seeley.civ@us.navy.mil,,"A.?? ?INTRODUCTION Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport Division (NUWCDIVNPT) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) solely for information and planning purposes to conduct market research in support of Handling Systems Engineering Code 1534 In Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) for Towed Array Handling Systems. Interested parties will provide industry solutions for inspection of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?) in a marine environment. Many commercial off the shelf (COTS) products in the industries of sewer, heat exchanger, and pipe manufacturing inspection fulfill most but not all of the desired requirements. ? Interested companies with the technologies capable of meeting the desired general requirements may submit responses that include products current and expected capabilities with modifications. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will reimburse no costs associated with response to this RFI. B.?? ?BACKGROUND The US Navy is seeking information on the industry capabilities for inspection system of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?). ?This pipe will be referred to as a guide or stowage tube, and is part of a system that a Towed Array travels through on deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection systems major components would consist of a user control system, inspection device, and cable storage. ?This system would need to be portable so it could be deployed and setup pier side to access the entry point on the vessel. ?Power would be provided by a battery and/or use standard 120 VAC 60Hz power. ?The maximum working length needed to inspect a guide or stowage tube will account for distance from system user control station to entry of guide or stowage tube. ?Diver support would be used to assist the inspection effort and access the guide or stowage tube entry point. ?Due to limitations of access, an inspection device using internal sensors is preferred, as clearance for external sensors is limited. ?Along the inspection run, the inspection device must traverse a minimum bend radius. ?These bend radius sections are through roller box assemblies, which consist of rollers made of Delrin, which reduce friction through these turns during deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection device would need to be waterproof and operate in a marine environment (regular immersion in salt water). ?This desired inspection device must be able to provide visual and measurement data of reasonable resolution in real time via a user control station and save this data for post analysis using a removable storage device. ?Accurate measurement would be expected for the following conditions of the stowage or guide tube: ?submerged in saltwater, partially submerged, or empty. ?Data collection is expected to be completed in a work day (8-12 Hrs.), for the required length of guide or stowage tube. ?The systems provided software program can be used to view visual and measurement data in real time. ?The location of the inspection device would be tracked and used to mark locations of interest for post analysis. ?This program could also be used to export data to commonly available software using removable storage media. ?For post analysis, standalone PC software is used to analyze ?raw? data from inspection system to generate a CAD file or inspection report. The small diameter pipe is part of either a Thinline or Fatline Towed Array Handling System (TAHS). ?Where the pipe is referred to as a guide tube in a Thinline system, and stowage tube in a Fatline system. ?The primary differences between these two systems is working length, pipe diameter, minimum bend radius, and presence of roller boxes. ?Requirements will be separated for inspection of each handing system, however there is interest in an inspection system capable of meeting the combined requirements of each handling system. Authorized personnel will provide feedback and any technical data necessary to facilitate responses on industry capabilities. C.?? ?REQUIREMENTS The following are the requirements of the inspection system: ? See Attached Thinline Guide Tube Inspection Requirements See Attached Fatline Stowage Tube Inspection Requirements 1. Thinline Towed Array Handling System: Measure Pipe Size: 2.00 in. Nominal Diameter Min. Bend Radius: 4 ft. Travel Through Roller Boxes: YES Max. Device Size: 1.45 in. Nominal Diameter Rigid Body Length at Max. Dia.: 5 in.? Cable Working Length: at least 325 ft. 2. Fatline Towed Array Handling System: Measure Pipe Size: 4.00 - 5.56 in. Nominal Diameter Min. Bend Radius: 8 ft. Roller Boxes: NO Max. Device Size: 3.5 in. Nominal Diameter Rigid Body Length at Max. Dia.: 9 in.? Cable working length: at least 400 ft. 3. Combined Thinline and Fatline System: Measure Pipe Size: 2.00 ? 5.56 in. Nominal Diameter Min. Bend Radius: 4 ft. Travel Through Roller Boxes: YES Max. Device Size: 1.45 in.

If only one Elevator at a time can be removed from service, can project take 365 days? VA Response: The period of performance is hereby modified to 365 days after Notice to Proceed. For the duration of the project at least one elevator must be running at all times for staff and patients. Question: 2 Under Scope of Work building 31 Elevator Upgrade section 4.d. It states Install new GEARED traction machines . Then under Section 4.m. It states Install new overhead GEARLESS traction hoist machines. Which section is required? VA Response: Paragraph 4.d is hereby deleted from the SOW. Follow Section 4.m. Question: 3 Under Scope of Work building 31 Elevator upgrade Section 4.i. It states install new Hoistway Entrances . Hoistway Entrances are actually part of the building and are set in concrete. A very large portion of the building must be removed as many parts of the Entrance are embedded in the wall. Typically these are never replaced. However Stainless Steel Entrance frames can be refinished or a skin can be applied. How does the VA want to proceed? VA Response: New Hoistway Entrances do not need to be installed. Paragraph 4.i is hereby removed from the SOW. Question: 4 Section 4.e. States to install Heat Detectors and Sprinklers. At this time current codes do not allow Sprinklers in any Traction Elevator space which would then eliminate the need for Heat Detectors. If sprinklers are still required can the VA provide existing Sprinkler schematics to utilize for modifications? VA Response: Existing sprinklers are to remain in the elevator shaft. Paragraph 4.e is hereby removed from the SOW. Question: 5 Section 4.hh. States to provide additional entrances where possible. Are these required? VA Response: New entrances are not required if they cannot be put in. See additional response to question 6 below. Question: 6 Scope of Work letter hh. States : Add Additional entrances where possible on floors that have only 1 side open. Car 1 does not open in the rear and if it did have a rear opening, it would open into single person offices. Please confirm that if rear opening is not required for Car 1? In addition, Car 3 does not have a front opening. Adding a front opening would require mail clutches and Sprinkler/Fire hose stations to be removed. Please clarify if a front opening will be required for Car 3? VA Response: No additional doors are required. Paragraph 4.hh is hereby removed from the SOW. Question: 7 The Scope of Work letter h. and letter x. states to ""Install New Stainless- Steel doors IAW ref (a) Section 5.0 Doors and Entrances. Replacing the doors entirely will be very intrusive to any patients on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floors. Re-skinning the doors instead is much less intrusive and quicker. Does the VA want the contractor to completely replace the doors, or re-skin them with new stainless steel wraps? VA Response: Install new elevator entrance doors IAW Ref (a), Section 5.0 Doors and Entrances. The Contractor may propose an alternative method if the structure of the doors are not needing repair/replacement, if the mechanism and door are fully operational and re- skinning is acceptable. Question: 8 Scope of Work letter cc. States "" Install new inserts for car guide shoes."" The Current elevators do not have sliding shoes. Please confirm it is acceptable for the contractor to replace the car and counterweight roller guides instead, as stated in letter ee? VA Response: Yes, this is acceptable. Question: 9 Scope of Work Letter ff. states ""Inspect the Hollister-Whitney ""Rope Gripper"" unintended movement protection device and refurbish and replace as needed. To clarify, refurbishment of this device will not be possible and we will replace the device instead. VA Response: Replacement is an acceptable solution, as stated. Question: 10 The Sam.gov page states this proposal is due on May 2nd, however the solicitation states it is due on May 12th. Could you confirm which date is correct? VA Response: Due date for offers is 5/12/2022 @ 1:00pm ET All other terms and conditions remain unchanged."

The ORNL Technology Transfer Office will accept license applications through May 19, 2022. Researchers at ORNL have developed an innovative ultrasonic drying technology using low-energy piezoelectric transducers to produce high-frequency vibrations to mechanically remove water from a variety of materials quickly and three times more efficiently than thermal drying (US Patent 10,520,252). This particular implementation of the technology is applied to clothes dryers. The technology utilizes ultrasound transducers to create a high frequency mechanical oscillation on the surface of the article subjected to drying or atomizing. More information can be found at this ORNL Technology Transfer webpage. License applications will be evaluated based on prospective partners' ability and commitment to successfully commercialize the technology, with a preference for United States-based businesses and small businesses.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this self-navigating drone technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Significant research has taken place in the drone industry for self-navigation technologies. However, this research has historically been focused on outdoor usage. These conventional drones rely on a strong GPS signal and a compass for successful navigation outside. These features give an outdoor drone vital position and heading information. However, both systems are unreliable (and sometimes inoperative) inside industrial facilities and similar environments without GPS availability. Commercial drones have not yet been optimized for indoor autonomous navigation. This technology was developed with nuclear power plants in mind but is a universal indoor self-navigation drone technology. Description:?? ?The concept of this effort is to leverage the drone camera to scan Quick Response codes (QR codes), or bar codes set at specific locations around the plant to guide the drone through a desired route. Utilizing QR codes posted at intervals throughout a plant, it is possible for a drone to know its physical location relative to these codes. Being able to process an image sent from the drone and get the position of the drone relative to the QR code will allow the drone to make decisions on how it moves, thus allowing it to navigate an indoor GPS-denied environment. As a result, the drone can navigate an area using just the onboard camera ? Benefits:????????? Self-navigation of drones in GPS-denied indoor environments. Able to be deployed to any commercially available drone. More cost-effective than other approaches like LiDAR and SLAM Applications:?? Self-navigation of drones in GPS-denied indoor environments. Development Status:? TRL 2. This technology is in early-stage concept phase. ? IP Status: ??????? Patent Application No. PCT/US20/60473, ?Image-Driven Self-Navigation of Drones in Indoor Environments,? BEA Docket No. BA-1141. INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities. Please visit Technology Deployment?s website at https://inl.gov/inl-initiatives/technology-deployment for more information on working with INL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.? Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.? The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.? The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.? To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).? Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed"

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.? Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.? The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.? The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.? To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).? Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.? 11. Place of Contract Performance: N/A 12. Set Aside: No 13: Archiving Policy: Manual 14.
