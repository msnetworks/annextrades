GENERAL INFORMATION Document Type: Request for Information (RFI) / Market Research Sources Sought: All Businesses ? Under North American Industry Classification System Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications. Closing Date for RFI: 10 June 2022 at 11 am, local time, Quantico, Virginia THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) OR PROPOSAL (RFP). This RFI is a market research tool, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, to determine the availability and adequacy of potential solutions prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a RFP. The Government will not reimburse for any information received from potential sources in response to this RFI. Any costs incurred responding to this RFI will be solely at the respondent?s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition. This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for, or award, a competitive or sole source contract.? 2. BACKGROUND The MCSC has an Approved Acquisition Objective to procure 111 MSAT systems beginning in or around Fiscal Year 24. The MSAT provides Marine forces assured SATCOM capabilities for operation through anticipated contested electronic warfare environments of near-peer and nation-state competitors. The system must be man-portable to support Expeditionary Advanced Based Operation and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment that have the distinctive operational characteristic of employing small, highly dispersed, and mobile teams. The MSAT will operate through SHF denied environments. It will provide technologies to mitigate jamming of its communications circuits. Additionally, it will provide technologies that limit the detection and monitoring of emissions. The size, weight, and power consumption of the system will be optimized for a system transit footprint of two cases (or less) that are each man-portable and fit in a commercial aircraft cabin overhead storage bin. The ultimate objective would be for a system that is man-packable in a single backpack. MSAT should support information throughputs of 8 Mbps or less. 3. DESCRIPTION Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Portfolio Manager, Command Element Systems, Program Manager Communications Systems, Product Manager Satellite Communications (SATCOM) seeks industry feedback and information on specific industry capabilities for a SATCOM Man-Portable Secure Anti-Jam Terminal (MSAT) solution. Feedback gathered from this effort will be compiled and used to refine the solicitation for a potential contracting effort in the future. The MSAT is a system within the Marine Corps Wideband Satellite Communications Family of Systems that provides deployed Marine forces operational capabilities to both maintain Command and Control of current and future dispersed operational units and to access Defense Information Systems Network services. The MSAT will provide assured broadband communications for units in environments where normal Super High Frequency (SHF) communications (military and civilian) are degraded or denied. A degraded or denied environment is defined as existing when an adversary uses active measures to disrupt normal satellite communications.? 4. RESPONSE REQUESTED The purpose of this RFI is to provide Marine Corps decision makers with a better understanding of existing systems and technologies for MSAT design and development. Responses may leverage existing military systems (e.g., Advanced Extremely High Frequency, Evolved Strategic SATCOM) or commercial systems. The Government requests respondents provide comments on the questions outlined below. Responses shall be limited to 15 pages or less. The Marine Corps is requesting the following information: Identify existing technologies and operational approaches to communicating in a denied or degraded environment. Identify off the shelf technologies and products that could provide the capabilities identified in (1) for MSAT. Identify the likelihood of systems identified in (2) to meet MSAT portability objectives for in-transit size and weight, and data throughput. Identify an estimated production lead-time for development and production of a MSAT system that provides the capabilities identified in (1) through (3), including any certification processes. 5. RFI RESPONSES Provide all feedback to lisa.bennett@usmc.mil and kassidy.probst@usmc.mil no later than the closing date listed in Section 1.? Please place ?MSAT RFI Response? in the subject line of your e-mail. After reviewing comments, the Government may set up a teleconference to discuss respondent?s information packages.

RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION 4.1 SUMMARY NAVSEA, on behalf of the Electric Ships Office (PMS 320, organizationally a part of the Program Executive Office Ships) is interested in White Papers for long and short term Research and Development (R&D) projects that offer potential for advancement and improvements in current and future shipboard electric power and energy systems at the major component, subsystem and system level. The mission of PMS 320 is to develop and provide smaller, simpler, more affordable, and more capable ship power systems to the Navy by defining open architectures, developing common components, and focusing Navy, industry, and academia investments. PMS 320 will provide leadership of the developments identified as part of this BAA, will direct the transition of associated technologies developed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), and will manage the technology portfolio represented by Program Element (PE) 0603573N (Advanced Surface Machinery Systems) for transition into existing and future Navy ships. 4.2 NAVAL POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP Naval power and energy systems are described in detail in the 2019 Naval Power and Energy Systems Technology Development Roadmap (NPES TDR). The NPES TDR focuses and aligns the power system investments for the Navy, Defense Department, industry and academia to guide future research and development investments to enable the Navy to leverage these investments to meet its future needs more affordably. Included in the NPES TDR are specific recommendations and opportunities for near, mid and long term investments, with a renewed focus on energy management. These opportunities range from an energy magazine to support advanced weapons and sensors to the development of an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES). The NPES TDR aligns electric power system developments with war fighter needs and enables capability-based budgeting. The NPES TDR is responding to the emerging needs of the Navy, and while the plan is specific in its recommendations, it is inherently flexible enough to adapt to the changing requirements and threats that may influence the 30-year ship acquisition plan. The first section of the roadmap establishes why NPES are a critical part of the kill chain based on the capabilities desired by the Navy in the near term, as well as supporting future platforms in the Navys 30-year shipbuilding plan. The second section of the roadmap presents power and energy requirements that are derived from mission systems necessary to support future warfighting needs. The third section describes required initiatives based on capabilities and the projected electrical requirements of the future ships. 4.3 FOCUS AREAS The areas of focus for this BAA include, but are not limited to, the ""FYDP/NEAR-TERM"" activities as described throughout the NPES TDR; the analysis, development, risk reduction and demonstration of future shipboard (both manned and unmanned) electric power systems and components, emphasizing shipboard power generation, electric propulsion, power conversion, energy storage, distribution and control; power quality, continuity, and system stability; electric power system and component level modeling and simulation; energy storage technologies; electrical system survivability; and power system simplicity, upgradeability, flexibility, and ruggedness. The Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) architecture provides the framework for partitioning the equipment and software into modules and defines functional elements and the power/control and information relationships between them. For power generation, high power distribution, propulsion, and large loads, the architecture includes Medium Voltage AC power (with emphasis on affordability), and Medium Voltage DC power (with emphasis on power density and fault management). For ship service electrical loads, the architecture includes zonal electrical distribution which may be either AC or DC, depending upon the specific application. Also of particular interest are technologies that result in significant energy efficiency, power density improvements and/or carbon footprint improvements over existing propulsion and power system technologies. The NPES TDR partitions the power system in to functional areas that include the following. 4.3.1 ENERGY STORAGE Energy storage modules may support short duration to long duration energy storage applications, which utilize a combination of technologies to minimize power quality and continuity impacts across the system. For the short duration energy storage applications, the module should provide hold-up power to uninterruptible loads for fault clearing and transient isolation, as well as load leveling for pulse power loads. For the mid duration, the module should provide up to approximately 3MW (100 - 150 kW-hr) of standby power for pulse power loads while also providing continuity of operations for a subset of equipment between uninterruptible and full ships load (including emergency power generation starting in a dark ship condition). For long duration applications, energy storage modules should provide the required power as an emergency backup system or to provide increased stealth for specialty equipment. The required duration for this type of application may extend up to days or longer, and may be intermittent or continuous. A number of energy storage technologies for future ship applications are of interest to the Navy, including various electrochemical, capacitor-based, or rotating discussed below: a. Capacitor: Electrochemical capacitor improvements continue to focus on improving energy density while maintaining inherently high-power density. Design improvements include development and integration of higher temperature films, advanced electrolytes, advanced electrode materials, and minimizing equivalent series resistance (ESR). b. Rotating: The Navy has interest in the investment from the transportation industry in flywheel systems that can handle gyroscopic forces continues to support flywheel usage in commercial rail and ground transportation. Additional factors of interest to the Navy include safety, recharge/discharge rates, ship motion impacts, environmental impacts and control. c. Electrochemical: Factors of interest to the Navy with respect to electrochemical energy storage include the ability to maintain state of charge when not in use; change in voltage versus state of charge; charge and discharge capability; the temporary or permanent loss of capacity due to repeated shallow discharges; the ability to shallow charge and discharge or partially charge intermittently during a discharge; battery life considerations such as service-life, cycle life, and shelf-life; off-gas properties that affect the level of ventilation and associated auxiliary systems; and safety enhancements to support qualification for use onboard US Navy ships. Near term Navy interests are in the area of common and scalable hardware and software elements which enable advanced weapons and sensors and in understanding the sizing algorithms for how to optimize energy storage sizing against various competing system requirements (short duration/high power vs. long duration/low power, for example. The specific design issues to be considered include reliability, volumetric and gravimetric power and energy densities, differentiating between high levels of stored energy and high energy density. The relevant information required for characterizing technology performance include: Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of components and systems; production capability; safety evaluation and qualifications performed on relevant subsystems or components (any hazard analyses of systems designs as relevant to notional applications); other military application of the devices; energy storage management system approach; thermal characteristics, constraints, and cooling requirements; auxiliary requirements (load); device impedance (heat generation characteristics); and device efficiency (discharge/recharge). 4.3.2 POWER CONVERSION Industry continues to drive towards increased power density, increased efficiency, higher switching frequencies, and refined topologies with associated control schemes. Innovation in power conversion from the development and implementation of wide-bandgap devices, such as Silicon Carbide (SiC), promise reduction in losses many times over Silicon. The use of high frequency transformers can provide galvanic isolation with reduced size and weight compared to traditional transformers. Advances in cooling methods will be required to handle larger heat loads associated with higher power operation. A typical Navy power conversion module might consist of a solid state power converter and/or a transformer. Advanced topologies and technologies, such as the application of wide band gap devices, are of particular interest. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to address converting high voltage AC/DC to 1000 VDC with power levels on the order of 3MW or larger. The specific design issues to be considered include modularity, open architecture (focusing on future power system flexibility and the ability of a conversion module within a ships power system to be replaced/ upgraded in support of lifecycle mission system upgrades), reliability, cost, and conversion efficiency. Areas of interest include more power-dense converters supporting advanced mission systems and prototyping of full scale conversion based on second generation wide-bandgap devices. 4.3.3 POWER DISTRIBUTION Power distribution typically consists of bus duct/ bus pipe, cables, connections, switchgear and fault protection equipment, load centers, and other hardware necessary to deliver power from generators to loads. Industry has used medium voltage DC (MVDC) transmission as a method to reduce losses across long distances. Complementarily, Industry is developing MVDC circuit protection for use in MVDC transmission variants of approximately 50, 100, and 150 megawatts (MW) at transmission voltages of 20 to 50 kVDC. Analysis includes modeling and simulation to determine methods for assessing the benefits of DC vs AC undersea transmission and distribution systems for offshore oil and gas. Industry and academia continue to invest resources in advanced conductors that have applications in power distribution, power generation, and propulsion. Research is focused on using carbon nanotubes. The development of a room temperature, lightweight, low resistance conductor is of great interest to the Navy. Areas of interest include development of an MVDC distribution system up to 12 kVDC to meet maximum load demands; design of an appropriate in-zone distribution system architecture; development of high speed 1 kVDC and 12 kVDC solid state circuit protection devices that are ship ready, and advanced conductors capable of supporting power distribution. 4.3.4 PRIME MOVERS (INCLUDING POWER GENERATION) Power Generation converts fuel into electrical power. A typical power generation module might consist of a gas turbine or diesel engine (prime mover), a generator (see rotating machine discussion below), a rectifier (either active or passive), auxiliary support sub-modules and module controls. Other possible power generation technologies include propulsion derived ship service (PDSS), fuel cells, or other direct energy conversion concepts. Power generation concepts include 60 Hz wound rotor synchronous generator driven directly by a marine gas turbine (up to 30 MVA rating); commercially derived or militarized design variants of the above; and higher speed, higher frequency, high power density variants of the above with high speed or geared turbine drive. NPES DC technologies permit prime movers and other electrical sources (such as energy storage) to operate at different, non-60Hz electrical frequency speeds, improving survivability, resiliency, and operational availability. Energy storage that is fully integrated with the power generation can enable uninterrupted power to high priority loads, mission systems that reduce susceptibility, and damage control systems to enable enhanced recoverability. The specific design issues to be considered include fuel efficiency, module level power density, machine insulation system characteristics, size, weight, cost, maintainability, availability, harmonic loading, voltage, power, system grounding approaches, fault protection, response to large dynamic (step) or pulse type loading originated from ship propulsion or directed energy/electromagnetic weapons, interface to main or ship service bus, autonomy, limited maintenance, and commercial availability. Navy interests are in the area of innovative approaches to power generation in the 5 to 30 MW range, utilizing gas turbines, diesel engines and other emerging power technologies that address challenges associated with achieving reduced fuel consumption, decreased life cycle and acquisition cost, support of ship integration, enable flexibility, enable power upgrades, and improved environmental compliance. Near term Navy interest includes 10-30 MW (nominally 25 MW) output power rating and the power generation source able to supply two independent electrical buses (where abnormal conditions, including pulsed/stochastic loads, on one bus do not impact the other bus) at 12 kVDC (while also considering 6kVDC, 18kVDC, and 1 kVDC). Enhanced fuel injection, higher operating temperatures and pressures, and optimized thermal management are critical for future prime movers. Advanced controls for increased efficiency, reduced maintenance, and increased reliability include implementation of digital controls; autonomous and unmanned power control; enhanced engine monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics; and distributed controls. Advanced designs for increased efficiency include new applications of thermodynamic cycles such as Humphrey/Atkinson cycle for gas turbines and diesels and Miller cycle for diesel. The Navy is interested in developing a knowledge bank of information on potential generator sets, generator electrical interface requirements, and the impacts of those requirements on generator set performance and size, as a logical next step from the Request for Information released under announcement N00024-16-R-4205. A long-term goal for this effort is to maximize military effectiveness through design choice and configuration option flexibility when developing next-generation distribution plants. The power generation source should fit within the length of a typical engine room (46 feet, including allowances for any needed maintenance and component removal). The power generation source is expected to have the ability to: control steady-state voltage-current characteristic for its interface; to maintain stability; and to adjust control set-points from system level controllers. For any proposed design approach, initial efforts would include conceptual design trade studies that inform the performance level that can be achieved. Trade studies may address Pulsed Load Capability (generator/rectifier design to increase pulse load capability, engine speed variation limits, and impact of cyclic pulse load on component life); Power Density (cost vs. benefits of high speed or high frequency, mounting on common skid, and advanced cooling concepts); Single vs. Dual Outputs (continuous vs. pulse rating for each output, voltage regulation with shared field, and control of load sharing); Efficiency (part load vs. full load optimization, flexible speed regulation, impact of intake and exhaust duct size/pressure drop on engine efficiency); Power Quality (voltage transient, voltage modulation for step, pulse loads, impact of voltage and current ripple requirements, and common mode current); PGM Controls (prime mover speed vs. generator field vs. rectifier active phase angle control, and pulse anticipation); Stability when operating in parallel with other sources; Short Circuit Requirements; and Dark Ship start capability (self-contained support auxiliaries). Trade studies may also address how rotational energy storage can be built into the design of the generator or added to the generator and what parameters need to be defined in order to exploit this capability. Development of advanced coatings and materials that support high temperature operations of a gas turbine is also of interest. Energy harvesting to convert heat energy and specifically low quality heat energy to electricity using solid state components is also of interest to the Navy. 4.3.5 ROTATING MACHINES (INCLUDING GENERATORS AND PROPULSION MOTORS) Recent trends in electrical machines include neural networks; artificial intelligence; expert system; fiber communications and integrated electronics; new ceramic conducting and dielectric materials; and magnetic levitation. High Temperature Superconducting rotors have higher power density than their induction and synchronous rotor counterparts. Wind power generators eliminate excitation losses which can account for 30% of total generator losses. The offshore wind power industry is moving to larger power wind tower generators in the 10MW class. Advanced low resistance room temperature wire and HTS shows promise for these higher power levels because of low excitation losses and low weight due to reduction in stator and rotor iron. HTS motors may be up to 50% smaller and lighter than traditional iron-core and copper machines. They have reduced harmonic vibrations due to minimization of flux path iron and have mitigated thermal cycling failures due to precision control of temperature. Propulsion motor concepts of interest to the Navy include Permanent Magnet Motors (radial air gap, axial air gap, or transverse flux), Induction Motors (wound rotor or squirrel cage), superconducting field type (homopolar DC or synchronous AC). The drivers and issues associated with these designs include acoustic signature, noise (requirements, limitations, modeling, sources, and mitigation methods), shock, vibration, thermal management, manufacturing infrastructure, machine insulation system characteristics, commercial commonality, platform commonality, cost, torque, power, weight, diameter, length, voltage, motor configuration, and ship arrangements constraints. Motor drives that may be explored include cyclo-converter (with variations in control and power device types), pulse width modulated converter/inverter (with many variations in topology), switching (hard switched, soft switched), and matrix converter (with variations in control, topology, cooling, power device type). Technologies for drives and rotating machines which allow the ability to operate as a motor and a generator to facilitate a PDSS installation or on a fully integrated power system to leverage the inherent energy storage in the ship's motion may be explored. Integrated motor/propulsor concepts may be considered either as aft-mounted main propulsion or as a forward propulsor capable of propelling a ship at a tactically useful speed. Areas of interest for future rotating machines include increased magnetic material flux carrying or flux generation capacity; improved electrical insulation material and insulation system dielectric strength; increased mechanical strength, increased thermal conductivity, and reduced sensitivity to temperature; improved structural materials and design concepts that accept higher torsional and electromagnetically induced stress; innovative and aggressive cooling to allow improved thermal management and increased current loading; increased electrical conductor current carrying capacity and loss reduction. 4.3.6 COOLING AND THERMAL MANAGEMENT As the demand and complexity of high energy loads increases, so does the demand and complexity of thermal management solutions. Assessing and optimizing the effectiveness of a thermal management system requires the analysis of thermal energy acquisition, thermal energy transport, and thermal energy rejection, storage, and conversion. The design of the thermal management system aims to transfer the thermal energy loads at the sources to the sinks in the most efficient manner. Areas of interest to the Navy with respect to cooling and thermal management include the application of two phased cooling and other advanced cooling techniques to power electronics and other NPES components and innovative approaches to manage overall ship thermal management issues including advanced thermal architectures, thermal energy storage systems, increases in efficiency, and advanced control philosophies. 4.3.7 POWER CONTROLS Controls manage power and energy flow within the ship to ensure delivery to the right load in the right form at the right time. Supervisory power system control typically resides on an external distributed computer system and therefore does not include hardware elements unless specialized hardware is required. The challenge to implement Tactical Energy Management (TEM) is to integrate energy storage, power generation, and interfaces with advanced warfighting systems and controls. TEM is critical to enabling full utilization of the capabilities possible from technologies under development. The state complexity and combat engagement timelines for notional future warfighting scenarios are expected to exceed the cognitive capacity and response times of human operators to effectively manage the electric plant via existing control system schema in support of executing ship missions. The survivability requirements for military ships combined with the higher dynamic power characterisitics (pulse load) characteristics of some mission systems will require more sophisticated control interfaces, power management approaches, and algorithms than are commercially available. The Navy is pursuing a long term strategy to create a unified, cyber secure architecture for machinery control systems that feature a common, reusable, cyber hardened machinery control domain specific infrastructure elements; a mechanism for transitioning new technology from a variety of sources in an efficient and consistent manner; and a mechanism to provide life cycle updates and support in a cost effective and timely manner.?TEM controls will be expected to maintain awareness of the electric plant operating state (real time modeling); interface with ship mission planning (external to the electric plant control systems) for energy resource prioritization, planning, and coordination towards the identification of resource allocation states that dynamically optimize mission effectiveness; identify and select optimal trajectories to achieving those optimal resource allocation states; and actuate the relevant electric plant components to move the electric plant state along those optimized trajectories towards the optimal resource allocation state. TEM controls would enable reduced power and energy system resource requirements for a given capability (or improved capability for a given set of resources); increased adaptability of the Navy?s power and energy system design to keep pace with an evolving threat environment; and maximized abilities to execute the ship?s mission. The Navy is interested in potential applications of distributed control architectures that have led to the development of intelligent agents that have some autonomous ability to reason about system state and enact appropriate control policies. A simple example of these agents in a control system is the use of autonomous software coupled with smart meters in a smart grid implementation. The agents, smart meters in this example, can temporarily shut off air conditioning but not the refrigerator in residences during grid peak power usage times when the cost per watt is highest on hot days. The agent software acts autonomously within its authority to comply with programmed customer desires. The Navy is interested in TEM controls within a modular open systems architecture framework such that they are agnostic of, but affordably customizable to, specific ship platforms and power system architectures.? TEM controls may reside between (i.e. interface with) embedded layers within individual power system components, ships? supervisory machinery control systems, and ships? mission planning systems. Initial or further development or modification of these interfaces may be required to achieve desired performance behaviors and characteristics. TEM controls are expected to develop within a model-based system engineering and digital engineering environment and will be initially evaluated in a purely computational environment, representing Navy-developed shipboard-representative power and energy system architecture(s), but will be progressively evaluated on systems with increasing levels of physical instantiation (i.e., controller-hardware-in-loop and power-hardware-in-loop with progressive levels of representative power system components physically instantiated). When implementing a TEM based control scheme, the overall power system should increase installed power generation available to mission and auxiliary loads; reduce power system design margins; hone the installed stored energy required for mission critical capability; and allow higher power transients (ramp rates and step loads). Other areas of interest to the Navy with respect to controls include improvements to traditional machinery control and automation, advanced power management, cyber security, and advanced controls for distributed shared energy storage and maintaining electrical system stability. The Navy is also interested in non-intrusive load monitoring, power system data analytics, real time system monitoring and onboard analysis and diagnostics capabilities. 4.3.8 SYSTEM INTERPLAY, INTERFACING, AND INTEGRATION Increasingly, the Navy is recognizing the need for incorporating flexibility and adaptability into initial ship designs and recognizing that the integration of new systems and the ability to rapidly reconfigure them will be an ongoing challenge throughout a platform's life cycle in order to maintain warfighting relevancy. The ability to support advanced electrical payload warfighting technologies requires not only power and energy systems delivered with the flexibility and adaptability to accommodate them, but a NPES engineering enterprise with the capability and capacity (knowledge, labor, and capital) for continuous systems integration. The Navy can more affordably meet this challenge by shifting as much effort as possible into the computational modeling and simulation regime. An Integrated Power System (IPS) provides total ship electric power including electric propulsion, power conversion and distribution, energy storage, combat system support and ship mission load interfaces to the electric power system. Adding Energy Storage and advanced controls to IPS results in an Integrated Power and Energy System (IPES) in order to accommodate future high energy weapons and sensors. The IPES Energy Magazine is available to multiple users, and provides enhanced power continuity to the power distribution system. The flexibility of electric power transmission allows power generating modules with various power ratings to be connected to propulsion loads and ship service in any arrangement that supports the ships mission at the lowest total ownership cost (TOC). Systems engineering in IPS/IPES is focused on increasing the commonality of components used across ship types (both manned and unmanned) and in developing modules that will be integral to standardization, zonal system architectures, and generic shipbuilding strategies with standard interfaces that are Navy-controlled. IPES offers the potential to reduce signatures by changing the frequency and amplitude of acoustic and electromagnetic emissions. Integrated energy storage can reduce observability by enabling the reduction and elimination of prime movers, thereby reducing thermal and acoustic signatures. The modules or components developed will be assessed for applicability both to new construction and to back-fit opportunities that improve the energy efficiency and mission effectiveness. Areas of Navy interest are to continuously improve IPS/IPES by performing analysis, modeling and simulation..."

The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The Government will evaluate quotes for acceptability, but will not rank the quotes by the non-price factors. If the Government receives three (3) or fewer initial quotes, all quotes will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. If the Government receives more than three (3) initial quotes, the Government will only select the three (3) lowest TEP quotes and then evaluate them for Technical Acceptability. The Government reserves the right to evaluate additional quotes for technical acceptability if it is in the Government?s best interest to do so. If additional quotes are evaluated for technical acceptability, they will be selected in the order of TEP. An offeror?s TEP will be the sum of all CLINS 0001 through 0004. EVALUATION FACTORS The Government anticipates awarding a contract to the offeror whose quote provides the best value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.

The technical evaluation factors upon which an offeror?s technical quote will be evaluated and the respective standard of acceptability for each of the technical evaluation factors are set forth below. The following adjectival ratings and rating definitions will be used to assign a rating for each technical factor and an overall rating to each technical quote. Adjectival Rating Description????

Description of Requirement Advances in DNA sequencing technology enable scientists to rapidly determine the genomic makeup of various organisms, detect mutations and polymorphisms associated with diseases, define genetic variations of pathogens and their infectivity, reveal patterns of gene expression (transcriptomes), elucidate functions of various RNA species, etc. The extent of achievement relies significantly on the availability of modern DNA sequencers. Scientists in our lab at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) conduct research as well as perform regulatory functions. To meet the needs of DNA sequencing, we use ABI capillary DNA sequencers for sequencing analysis. The number of samples for DNA sequencing in general falls in the range between 60 and 400 per day. To prepare for large number of samples, sequencing reagents such as fluorescent dye (sold as BigDye kit, BDT) and Pop-7 polymer and capillary arrays need to be stocked to avoid supplies shortage. This request is to purchase BigDye kits, Pop-7 polymer, and 24- and 48-capillary arrays, buffers, and plates to be used in capillary DNA sequencing"

In effort to reduce significant future costs due to stringent Range Safety requirements and Diminished Manufacturing Supply and Material Shortages (DMSMS) impacts, the Government requests Boeing provide an analysis, outlining an effective approach and best practices for acquiring piece parts that require extensive lead time.? This approach should consider Range Commander?s Council (RCC) 319 Appendix B and latest FT3 Parts Management Plan applicability for future lot screening and qualification efforts.? Boeing?s analysis should include lead time and costs for materials. The Government has attached a draft CLIN structure as previously collaborated with Boeing to assist with organizing the proposal.

In response to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Boeing shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408.? Further, Boeing shall (1) utilize the DFARS 252.215-7009, Proposal Adequacy Checklist (PAC) (attached to this RFP letter), in pre-submission proposal quality reviews, and (2) furnish the completed checklist as part of its proposal submission. The responsibility for providing a well-prepared and fully supported cost proposal lies solely with Boeing.? The basis and rationale for all proposed costs shall be provided as part of the proposal so that the Contracting Officer (CO) has the information necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price. If Boeing is unsure as to whether a checklist item is required in support of the proposal, or how to adequately comply with a checklist item, Boeing shall contact the Contracting Officer as soon as possible after receipt of the RFP, but in any case prior to proposal submittal, to resolve the questions. Non-compliances with the DFARS Proposal Adequacy Checklist and the additional requirements of this provision will require immediate correction.? However, completion of the checklist does not relieve Boeing from the responsibility to comply with all applicable regulations and any special requirements of the solicitation. Boeing is encouraged to flow down this provision to subcontractors/affiliates required to submit certified cost or pricing data in support of this RFP. Boeing is advised that the contracting officer may find costs associated with revision/rework of inadequate cost proposals unreasonable, and will consider the nature and extent of any proposal inadequacies when assessing/negotiating profit. In order to preclude delays in negotiations and contract award, the completed PAC submitted with the proposal shall provide a clear explanation for any checklist items not included in the proposal, particularly items not provided based on any of the five exceptions to TINA found at FAR 15.403-1(b). Cost Proposal Requirements. In addition to the requirements identified in the DFARS PAC, the following also apply to the cost proposal submitted in response to this RFP. Breakout by Year. If the proposal includes more than one CLIN, the proposal shall include a breakout of CLIN prices by cost element by Contractor Fiscal Year (CFY). At the Contracting Officer?s direction, the breakout by year shall also be provided by: ? X? ?Government Fiscal Year (GFY) ? X? ?Calendar Year (CY) The proposal shall define the timeframe of the Contractor Fiscal Year (for example, January ? December). If the proposal includes more than one CLIN/subCLIN, recurring/non-recurring costs shall be identified for each CLIN/subCLIN. When the proposal includes material costs, the proposal shall include a consolidated bill of materials (CBOM) at the total contract level in an electronic, sortable format (Excel spreadsheet). When the amounts proposed in the CBOM include application of escalation, the proposal shall identify the base value, the escalation rate(s) used, and the escalation amount associated with each item escalated. When the proposed amount is based on historical data which has been adjusted (for example, for differences in quantity), the CBOM shall clearly identify the adjustments made to the historical data and the reason for each adjustment. All costs proposed on the basis of Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall be fully supported. The proposal shall identify the basis for the proposed rate, shall identify the base to which the rate is applied, and shall clearly demonstrate the calculation of proposed costs based on CERs. For any costs incurred prior to proposal submission, the proposal shall identify actual hours and cost incurred as well as hours/costs to complete and the time phasing associated with these hours/costs. This information/data shall be provided in a time-phased cost element summary format. Submission of Historical Actual Costs Incurred. ?Boeing shall provide with its proposal historical Actual Costs Incurred (ACI) data for any similar efforts within the past 3 years. The contractor shall provide the following information for these prior acquisitions: a. contract number (including modification number if applicable) or other identifier; b. contract type; c. contract quantity; d. contract price; and e. actual cost incurred, including a breakout of actuals as recurring/non-recurring costs. If performance is not complete on any of the specified contract actions, provide an estimate to complete and the basis for that estimate. The contractor shall also request that its top five major sole source subcontractors provide the information listed in the above paragraphs (i) a. through e. on prior contracts for items the prime is purchasing from the subcontractors for this effort. If a subcontractor?s information on prior actuals is not included in the prime?s proposal, the proposal should identify status and anticipated receipt date(s). If the subcontractor deems the information proprietary, the subcontractor may submit the information directly to the CO. The proposal shall identify those actions where assist audits have been requested by the prime or sub-tier contractors and identify the request date and scheduled receipt date for those audits. The need for assist audits resulting from proprietary data rights assertions at any tier shall be identified to the Contracting Officer as soon as Boeing becomes aware of the need. Government performance of assist audits does not relieve Boeing of the responsibility to accomplish and provide its price/cost analysis of the subcontracts. Commercial item considerations: Boeing proposal shall provide support for any subcontractor Commercial Item Determinations (CID), addressing, at a minimum, the following: A description of the supplies or services; Specific identification of the type of commercial item claim (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (8)), and the basis on which the item meets the definition; and For modified commercial items (commercial item sub-definition (3)), classification of the modification(s) with supporting rationale as either: Of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(i)); or A minor modification of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace made to meet Federal Government requirements (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definition (3)(ii)). Note that per FAR 15.403-1(c)(3)(iii)(B), modifications that meet the definition of minor modifications of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace as defined in FAR 2.101, paragraph (3)(ii) of the commercial item definition, will require the submission of certified cost and pricing data when the total price of all such modifications exceeds the greater of the threshold for certified cost or pricing data (FAR 15.403-4) or 5% of the total price of the contract at the time of contract award. ii. For proposed subcontract commercial items ?of a type?, or ?evolved? or modified (FAR 2.101 commercial item sub-definitions (1) through (3)), the offeror shall provide a technical description of the differences between the proposed item and the comparison item and thoroughly address the cost differences between the proposed item and the comparison item. The proposal shall include, or Boeing shall make available, data other than certified cost or pricing data to establish price reasonableness of the proposed subcontract commercial item (to include any modifications not subject to the requirement to submit certified cost or pricing data) by supplying: Information/data related to competition, if competition is Boeing?s basis for asserting the reasonableness of the proposed subcontract price. Information/data related to prices (sales data, market price assessments, etc.). Note that subcontractors may submit sales data directly to the CO if the subcontractor deems the data proprietary. The prime contractor?s or higher tier subcontractor?s price analysis/price reasonableness determination for the commercial subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b)(1) and (2). Cost information/data (cost element breakdown and supporting documentation not subject to certification in accordance with FAR 15.406-2). Instances where cost information may be required include but are not limited to commercial items offered but never actually sold to the public, ?of a type? commercial items, or when sales data is limited and/or not recent and/or not for the same/similar quantities. Note that the preferred method of establishing the price reasonableness of commercial items is to obtain commercial sales data.? It is recognized that other methods, such as market price assessment data or evaluation of cost data not subject to certification, are also acceptable when prior sales data cannot be obtained.? Sales data shall (1) demonstrate sales to the general public; (2) be current; and (3) where possible, be in like quantities.? Items sold to state, local, or foreign governments or items sold with applications only to state, local, or foreign government or US Government end items are not considered to be sales to the general public unless the proposed commercial item meets the FAR 2.101 commercial item definition sub-definition (8). Submission of electronic cost model.? The proposal submission shall include an electronic cost model with active formulas demonstrating the mathematical calculation of the proposed cost (in Excel).? The electronic cost model shall include build-up by year of cost in total and by CLIN/subCLIN, consistent with the yearly breakout required by paragraph (d)(1) of this provision, or as directed by the Contracting Officer.? If applicable, the electronic cost model shall link each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to the applicable CLINs.? The electronic cost model shall roll up to an annual and total program summary by cost element.? All information supporting each CLIN should be visible and verifiable in the electronic cost model.? The formulas included in the electronic cost model shall not be locked, and the model shall be editable by the Government.

This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside this requirement among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms. In the National Airspace System (NAS), Air Traffic Management (ATM) personnel rely on a variety of decision support tools and sources of information to perform their jobs. Controllers use their primary radar displays to monitor air traffic and operational information and make tactical decisions resulting in potential new clearances and information to the aircraft. However, operational personnel often need information in addition to that on their primary display (e.g., radar display, Traffic Situation Display (TSD), oceanic display) to assist in operational situations they encounter. The display of this information is provided through what is generally referred to as Information Display Systems (IDSs). E-IDS will provide an enterprise-level platform that implements, augments and/or replaces the multiple types of IDSs in, or in support of the NAS, including but not limited to En Route, Terminal, Traffic Flow, Oceanic and Offshore domains with common hardware and software. E-IDS will provide displays in over 500 FAA Air Traffic Control facilities and cover approximately 5000 controller positions. The FAA is currently working with the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) to select a Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) touchscreen display. The selected display will be installed on Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) compatible mounts allowing controllers to adjust and move the screen as needed. In many facilities, the display is located within a short distance from a controller?s head. As a result, the FAA must provide PSE that can be installed on the display to eliminate sharp edges that can lead to head injuries. The FAA is also seeking a solution that provides or incorporates grab handles for easy maneuvering of the display. The FAA will provide specifications for the selected display at a later date, but based on experience and projected needs, the agency intends to implement PSE for a 24-inch display. The PSE must meet the following anticipated minimum requirements: Withstand 24 hours a day, 365 (366 leap year) days a year operation, in an indoor environment. Operate without degradation at temperatures between 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Operate at a relative humidity between 30% - 80% at a temperature range of 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Not emit ?out gas? fumes or contain any hazardous materials (e.g., mercury, acetone, asbestos, etc.) Not breakdown when cleaned or handled. Not breakdown due to display heat or exposure to direct sunlight. Be non-porous to prevent absorption of cleaning fluids or body oils. Eliminate sharp edges of the display. Absorb physical impact with users or other equipment. Maintain or increase the physical integrity and stability of the display. Not obstruct any screen area from any angle, either physically or visually. Provide access to the power button, but also obstruct light from the button. Provide access to all buttons (by appropriate personnel), but not expose buttons enough to allow Users to inadvertently turn off the display or change settings unintentionally. Not obstruct access to any of the display?s ports. Not increase the ?remove and replace? time for the display by more than 2 minutes. Not add more than 1 pound of weight to the display. Not add more than 1 inch to height and width of the display. Not obstruct the VESA mount in any way that prevents its use. Provide grab handles, or a sturdy ?grab area? on all 4 sides integrated into the PSE (e.g., recessed area) to accommodate maneuvering of the display. The FAA currently plans to release a Screening Information Request/Request for Proposal (SIR/RFP). At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do an unrestricted competition, or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a suitable COTS product, or a vendor-designed and produced display PSE, meeting the minimum requirements above. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 339113. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: Submission of a capability statement that clearly demonstrates: (a) the administrative and technical skills and experience required to fully comply with the requirements of this effort; and (b) the ability to work successfully within the FAA infrastructure in complying with the safety, security, and operational requirements contained in FAA Orders and Advisory Circulars for performance of duties on airport property or within the confines of secured FAA facilities. Responses must be submitted on company letterhead, in a type font no less than 12 point and shall not exceed 10 pages in total length. Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.? Interested vendors must include the Unique Entity Identification Code (UEI) registered in SAM.gov and state business size. The FAA will not pay any costs vendors incur as a result of participation in this market survey. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public. Any proprietary information submitted must be adequately marked as proprietary and will be protected accordingly.
