When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 5.

The current posture as it relates to COVID has led to a large decline in the number of cleared interpreters required. In 2020 we used 231.00 SCI hours, 150.00 Top Secret hours and 2,163.50 Secret hours. All labor hour are driven by requests for cleared services. 3. Can the State Department provide a historical data breakdown from the past year on: The total number of hours of services (for ASL Interpreting and CART services) a. The number of all-day on-call assignments (interpreters/writers scheduled 7 or more hours per day on the same days each week) ? We currently request services for 6 daily on-call interpreters (8 hours) and 1 oncall for 6 hours. b. The number of assignments that were 3 hours or less c. The number of assignments that were 7 hours or more d. The number of hours of evening/weekend work ? 2021 we had 0 Weekend hours. ? 2019 we had 2 Saturday (24.00) requests and 4 Sunday (23.50) requests e. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 5 business days? notice) f. The number of short-notice assignments (less than 1 business days? notice) ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2021 we had 294 requests totaling 742.50 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2020 we had 287 requests totaling 611.25 hours. ? Less than 72 hours? notice ? 2019 we had 360 requests totaling 513.75 hours g. How many requests were outside of the main location? ? 2019 we supported one employee daily for 8 hours OCONUS with a TS/SCI clearance ? 2019, 2021 and 2022 we also provide 8 hours daily interpreting on the West Coast at one of our locations. ? We provide interpreting services in New Orleans, New York and San Francisco with less than 8 hours per month. 4. In the RFI document, it states ?Interpret and/or transliterate continuously for not more than two (2) hours at a time without a break. In order to prevent repetitive motion injuries industry standard requires 2 interpreters for assignments requiring over 1.5 hours of continuous interpreting. Will the State Department confirm that a team will be provided when there will be 1.5 hours or more of continuous interpreting? ? Our ASL team is comprised of Certified Sign Language Interpreters who actively provide interpreting services for the Department. Each request is approached as not only fulfilling the assignment but also ensuring that the integrity of the message can be maintained while examining factors such as length of time, technicality, number of customers involved etc. The Department follows the 2-hour minimum as a rule with consideration given to other factors. 5. The RFI states there is a requirement for CART but does not specify whether the requirement is for onsite or remote CART. Will the State Department clarify whether it requires onsite or remote CART or both? ? The Government requires both. CART usage Is low (2019 - 19 requests totaling 114 hours). 6. There is a drastic difference between on-site CART writer and remote CART writer with on-site CART needing a 30-minute set-up time prior to the start of an assignment and each having very different minimum charges. Will the State Department recognize the difference when issuing their solicitation in the future? We suggest adding a CLIN to allow separate pricing for these services so that vendors can provide the most competitive pricing possible. ? Yes, we will consider this. ? All service providers are required to arrive 30 minutes prior to the assignment to provide enough time to get to the location and to be ready to begin at the designated time. In the case of interpreters, this time is not billed.

While the contract is administered by GTM/OAA/DRAD, the contractor will work independently with the employee requiring the accommodation.? The RASS shall operate autonomously demonstrating a high degree of professional autonomy and integrity in their work.? They shall employ a high level of critical thinking skills and techniques to ensure barrier free access.? While the RASS do not take ownership of the work product, the RASS may provide support to facilitate seamless and unencumbered accommodations to the employee. While consistency is the hallmark of an effective accommodation, there may be periods when services must transition to another RASS.? They shall maintain handover notes outlining processes used within the tailored accommodation to facilitate a smooth transition to the incoming RASS. ?Notes shall include, file locations, formatting conventions, any key point that will assist an incoming RASS in maintaining continuity of services. If the DoS employee requiring the accommodation does not need services, the RASS may be assigned to support administrative functions for the GTM/OAA Director, GTM/OAA Deputy Director and the GTM/OAA/DRAD and GTM/OAA/AD chiefs. When this occurs, these duties are secondary and may never take priority over their primary responsibilities.? POSITION 3 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION SUPPORT SPECIALIST II (RASS-II) (2) DOS employees requiring a RASS II accommodation have been identified by DRAD as employees who require a higher level of commitment and support.? Typically, employees who require this level of assistance work at senior executive levels.? This may include an increased need to adjust hours of work to match the customer and may include an increased need for travel beyond the standard workstation. Other aspects of the work environment requiring a heightened level of attention: Experience ? A RASS II must have previous experience providing accessibility for someone who is blind or who has low vision.? They must have prior experience providing sighted guide and have worked with accessible technologies such as Job Access with Speech (JAWS). Note Taking ? Ensuring notes are accurate, concise and that notes are captured electronically the same day for access by the employee. Time management ? Ensuring scheduling is handled in a manner that empowers the employee to effectively manage their time.? This includes ensuring the calendar is always updated, indicators of timing is conveyed to employee during meetings and/or relational to events, and discussions with employee to manage expectations on a daily/weekly basis. Initiative ? Logistics need to be driven by the DOS employee, but initiative must be taken by the RASS II to ensure preparations are completed to allow the employee seamless access to the physical and electronic environment of the work.? This includes prioritization of what needs to be made accessible for the meetings such as documents, bios, pictures and collecting information needed prior to meetings, during the meetings and after the meetings and ensuring it is accessible to the employee. Travel Logistics ? Coordinating travel requirements pre travel advising on aspects of accommodations and ensuring accessibility is coordinated pre, during and post travel. Assertiveness ? The RASS II will be providing access for employees at a senior level.? It is essential that the RASS II is assertive and able to drive the accommodation instead of relying on the DOS employee to always provide direction.? They must be able to provide this level of assertiveness including the employee so they are empowered to perform their work effectively.? POSITION 4 ? PERSONAL ASSISTANT SERVICES (PAS) PROVIDER (1) The Department may have the need for one (1) qualified full-time employee to provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) for eligible employees or applicants.? Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 791, and its implementing regulation , 29 CFR1614.203 requires DOS to provide PAS to eligible employees who, because of severe disabilities, require such assistance in order to be at work or participate in work-related travel.? PAS are services that help individuals with disabilities perform activities of daily living, including, such as, assistance with removing and putting on clothing, eating, and using the restroom.? Additionally, PAS could include providing travel assistance to an employee or retrieving work materials that are out of reach.? GTM/OAA/DRAD determines eligibility for PAS.? DOS employees with severe disabilities determined to be eligible for services are hereafter referred to as ?eligible employees?. The personal nature of the services and regulatory requirements, the preferences of GTM/OAA/DRAD and eligible employees must be taken into consideration.? The Contractor shall allow GTM/OAA/DRAD and/or eligible employees to meet/conference with Contract personnel referred for consideration and, if approved by GTM/OAA/DRAD, after selection/assignment to support and/or facilitate the delivery of care. PAS may be required to provide care to more than one eligible employee, depending on the eligible employee?s location, level of care, and schedule.? If more than one eligible employee is being supported and an eligible employee must travel on official business, whether local, domestic, or international, the Contractor must ensure services are provided for all assigned eligible employees.? The contractor must be proficient in identifying PAS providers worldwide to ensure the uninterrupted deliver of services. The PAS Provider: Shall preconference with the employee and the Program Office to identify specific employee needs, tasks to be performed and discuss accommodations. Notify GTM/OAA/DRAD whenever any significant changes to needs or tasks are identified.? All changes must be approved by the program office prior to implementation.

Informational Posting Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Enterprise Digitalization and Case Management Office Digitalization Technology Verticals The purpose of this special notice is to provide an update on the digitalization activities of the Enterprise Digitalization and Case Management Office (ED&CMO), which spearheads IRS efforts to empower taxpayers and IRS employees to rapidly resolve issues in a simplified digital environment. ?Specifically, it will: 1) provide a brief update on the three existing Technology Verticals, primarily to provide historical context for ED&CMO?s actions in this space; 2) outline initial tentative topic areas for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Technology Verticals; and, 3) provide context around considerations for any other new FY22 procurement needs. In FY21, ED&CMO issued three Technology Verticals using the Pilot IRS framework (on average, those procurement actions took less than 30 calendar days from solicitation to contract award). ?The three FY21 Technology Verticals focused on: 1) extracting machine readable data from low resolution and poor quality images and hard copy documents (summarized as Optical Character Recognition (OCR)); 2) digitalizing paper documents and transmitting the digital files back to the IRS via a digital channel (summarized as Scanning as a Service (SCaaS); and, 3) generate information which improves the taxpayer experience when a mobile device is directed at IRS images, forms, etc., based on publicly available information (summarized as Augmented Reality (AR)). ?As intended, all three Technology Verticals resulted in multiple awards with an initial period of 30 days to 6 months, followed by a targeted selection of a smaller number of industry partners for contract option exercise and continued funding. ?Each of the Technology Verticals has contributed significantly to the understanding and awareness of ED&CMO, and although industry partners in all three areas continue to be funded, additional investment in these areas will continue to be dependent on Return on Investment, the ability of the solutions to serve the needs of the IRS, and overarching prioritization decisions. In FY22, ED&CMO intends on issuing two to three additional Technology Verticals, again relying on the Pilot IRS framework. ?Currently, those Technology Verticals will focus on three topic areas: 1) the application of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Robotic Process Automation (AI/ML/RPA) in human resources processes (i.e., using automation to accelerate manual processes); 2) process and technology solutions to improve high-manual touch processes that have limited visibility before they are completed; and, 3) cryptocurrency and digital assets. ?ED&CMO anticipates finalizing the topic areas by April 30th. ED&CMO may have other procurement needs in FY22, but it does have existing vehicles (which were completed in FY20) that it will leverage for the majority, if not all, of these needs. ?As the topic areas for the Technology Verticals are finalized, ED&CMO will issue additional special notices, Requests for Information, and will provide ample opportunity to engage with our industry partners.?? ?

The juvenile specialist will primarily respond to Pleasanton Unified School District sites and within the community as needed for mental health calls for those under 18 years of age. A mental health clinician specializing in providing treatment to children, teens and families will respond to these situations. Given the complexity of interacting with children and families in crisis, a specialist with experience in this area is requested. The second clinician will specialize in adult mental health and substance abuse. This clinician will collaborate with outside mental health services that oversee adult case management and with the homeless liaison officers which would allow the Alternative Response to Mental Health Unit (ARHM Unit) to better serve the housed or unhoused living in a chronic state of mental health crisis. The ARMH Unit will be the initial touchpoint for persons in crisis and will have the knowledge, skills, and ability to refer to other local mental health service providers for case management.."

Tabulations for these solicitations should be available on Ionwave within 48 hours of the opening. In some cases, they may be available earlier. We ask that you limit exposure by viewing tabulations electronically through IonWave, rather than attending at City Hall.

Responses or parts of a response whether hardcopy or electronic that cannot be viewed may deem your submittal as non-responsive.

Bidders are encouraged to meet SMWBE participation levels established by the Director, Business Diversity Development, or, if unable to meet the participation level, engage in good faith efforts to joint venture, subcontract, or contract for supplies or services with SMWBEs. The attainment of the SMWBE participation level established for this contract is to be measured as a percentage of the total dollar value of the contract. The SMWBE participation level established for this Contract will be 7.55% MBE and/or WBE. This program maintains a list of certified SMWBEs, which can be found on the Authoritys website at https://flynashville.com/nashville-airport-authority/business-opportunities/business-diversity-development or certified DBEs located within the state of Tennessee, which can be found on the TNUCP Directory (TDOT) website at https://www.tdot.tn.gov/Applications/DBEDirect/Search or contacting Business Diversity Development at (615) 275-2718. Proposers are encouraged to inspect this list to assist in locating SMWBEs for the work. Other SMWBEs may be added to the list in accordance with MNAAs approved SMWBE Program. Credit toward the SMWBE participation will not be counted unless the SMWBE to be used is certified by MNAA.]



RIGHT TO REJECT ANY AND ALL BIDS.  MNAA proposes to award the Contract to the lowest responsive and responsible Bidder, provided it has met the goals for SMWBE participation or, if failing to meet the goals, has made an acceptable good faith effort to meet the established goals for the SMWBE participation.  Bidder is advised that MNAA reserves the right to reject any and all Bids submitted, to waive any and all informalities, irregularities and/or technicalities in any Bid or Bid Guaranty, to accept any Bid deemed advantageous to it and to negotiate changes, deletions, or additions to these Contract Documents with the successful Bidder."

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.

(2) (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

This requirement will be awarded as a Lowest Price Technically Accepted (LPTA) award. (b) Options.

(c)A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Therefore, the material has been designated as SPECIAL EMPHASIS material (Level I, Scope of Certification, or Quality Assured) and special control procedures are invoked to ensure receipt of correct material. 2. APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1 Order of Precedence - In the event of a conflict between the text of this contract/purchase order and the references and/or drawings cited herein, the text of this contract/purchase order must take precedence.

Specifically, the Government will procure this from Life Technologies Corporation. Life Technologies is the sole manufacturer and reseller of the 3500xL Genetic Analyzers, the associated 3500 computers and 3500 data collection software for this requirement.? AFMES-DNAOps is a forensic DNA testing laboratory that is accredited by the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB) to the ISO-17025 and FBI-QAS for DNA Forensic Laboratories. Based on accreditation adherence (Volume III of the Quality Manual and the FBI's Quality Assurance Surveillance document), all equipment and software must be developmentally validated by the manufacturer and internally validated by the laboratory to all reagents used for DNA testing as well as pass a stringent quality control before being released for casework. Furthermore, forensic accreditation standards say that manufactures who supply DNA forensic instruments, reagents must have established Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)/ Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) process as well as being International Standard Organization -18385 Forensic DNA grade accredited. Life Technologies is ISO 18385 compliant for the forensic mtDNA and STR reagents, the 3500xL capillary electrophoresis instruments (3500xL Analyzer, computers and 3500 data collection software), and the GeneMapper ID-X software v1.6 that are used to analyze forensic DNA samples. AFMES-DNAOps is the DoD?s only human remains DNA testing laboratory, which under title 10 USC, chapter 75, 1471 and 10 USC, Chapter 76, 1501-1513; NDAA 2010, Section 541 (d)(2) and DODI 5154.30 is charged with providing human remains DNA testing in support of current day operations (AFMES), past accounting operations (Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency; DPAA), other DoD Agencies missions, and other Bureaus of the Federal Government, and civilian medical institutions. Life Technologies is the sole manufacture of the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer and the 3500 Data collection software that AFMES-DNAOps purchased in 2010 to replace the obsolete and discontinued ABI 3130xL Genetic Analyzer. The Life Technologies 3500xL Genetic Analyzer, associated WIN7 computers and data collection software versions 1.0 to 1.3 have been validated in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Investigations ? Quality Assurance Standards (FBI-QAS) and the ISO-17025 Accreditation standards by AFMES-DNAOps to work in conjunction with the Promega Fusion and Life Technologies Globalfiler and MiniFiler autosomal Short Tandem Repeat (STR) kits, and the Life Technologies Y-Chromosomal STR kit. Development, optimization and validation of automated and manual STR amplification methods in conjunction with analysis on the 3500xL Genetic Analyzer are used to identify missing individuals. Failure to utilize the forensically validated 3500xL computers and data collection software will lead to a 50% reduction in work product. This reduction in work product will prevent AFMES- DNAOps from supporting the Defense POWMIA Accounting Agency in meeting the NDAA 2010, which requires the past accounting community to have the capability and capacity to support 200 identifications of missing service members from World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam, and the Cold War. This announcement fulfills the synopsis requirements under FAR 5.102 (a)(6) and 5.203(a). USAMRAA intends to publish a solicitation no sooner than 15 days after publishing this synopsis. This Special Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes. Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. If no written responses are received by the date listed below, which reflects at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this notice, the solicitation will be issued as sole source requirement.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this new radiation spectroscopy technique. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Various industries including nuclear, medical, and non-proliferation, have been using radiation spectroscopic analysis for decades. Despite its wide use, this technology has always struggled to provide accurate spectroscopy measurements for their applications. Efforts have been made, and continue, to improve the mathematical models for peak-fitting and subsequent analysis but the core concept of spectroscopy remains the same. Conventional methods commonly take many days to perform because of the substantial human factor involved in the analysis, just for the analysis to be inaccurate. All of these factors contribute to an increase in the financial and time expense, which leads user to either accept lower quality results, or forgo measurements all together. Description:?? ?Researchers at INL have developed a new method for spectroscopy that relies on networks of nonlinear, hierarchical learning functions like those used for image-classification. This process can identify and quantify the presence of radioisotopes by processing collected radiation spectra using advanced machine learning. Improvements in machine learning capabilities make it possible to design a technique which allows the computer to act in a similar fashion to an expert scientist analyzing a radiation spectrum. This method would not only substantially improve the capabilities of radiation spectra analysis but would also reduce or even eliminate the human factor involved with the conventional approach. Benefits:??? ?????? Using machine learning immunizes this method from uncertainties introduced by improper peak fitting or template matching involved in traditional methods. The results can be inferred in real time by a single forward pass of the trained network of learning functions, rather than a two-step collect, then analyze process like traditional methods. Real time analysis substantially reduces the time required to obtain the desired results from measurements. Applications:?? Any radiation spectroscopic analysis including, but not limited to: Neutron Gamma Ray X-ray Development Status:? TRL 3. Proof-of-concept has been completed via a prototype experiment.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this melt wire array fabrication technology. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????The harsh environment inside nuclear reactors makes it a challenge for a variety of materials form fuels to structural materials for their operations. Melt wires are a passive sensing technique to determine peak temperatures during a nuclear test under harsh radiation environment. Melt wire capsules are used by evaluating (during post irradiation examination) whether a melt wire melted. Currently, up to five wires can be placed in a single capsule. This yields some level of temperature resolution, but the manufacturing process is difficult and time consuming, while evaluating the wires during PIE is not easy. INL?s technology seeks to improve temperature resolution, add spatial resolution, and make both manufacturing and evaluation simple. Description:??? Researchers at INL have invented a technique to manufacture encapsulated melt wire chips for use in reactors via advanced printing techniques. The miniaturized melt wire sensors with two millimeters in diameter is capable of multiple melt wires in a single chip. The graded compositions allow for control over the melting temperatures of the wires and a level of spatial resolution for the temperature measurement. Evaluation of the melt arrays can be made electrically by incorporating printed pins into the substrate between adjacent wires and measuring the resistance between them. ? Benefits:??? ??????

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize the control drum system. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??? ????Nuclear reactors are generally large and thus the size of their flux control mechanisms (e.g., shutdown rods, control drums) have extensive volume which to occupy. The volume allows these mechanisms to be long, thus allowing component accessibility and displacing sensitive parts from the reactor environment (flux and thermal). However, microreactors do not supply this luxury of larger volumes or associated weight allowances and thus these mechanisms require a more compact, yet still accessible and environment tolerant, solution. ????????????????????????? Microreactors have a large breath of applications (electric power generation, hydrogen production, etc.) particularly in isolated environments. A multitude of technologies are being devised and each present their own system requirements including the mechanical control system?s abilities to effectively function in a restricted volume while also accommodating a wide range of conditions. Many of these control systems are devised specifically to the system in question and lack the flexibility to tune the various required performance features to complement the system needs (e.g., motion response times, torque requirements, shielding etc.). Description:?? ?Researchers at INL have developed a new control drum system design that employs a cage-like structure to efficiently use its components to achieve un-obvious, dual purpose functions. These functions allow it to be compact (volume/weight constraints), accessible (maintenance and control communication), thermally compatible (rails also act as thermal dissipaters), and flux compatible (intermediate platforms also act as shield agents). Benefits:??? ?????? Compact solution Efficiently utilizes its components to accommodate thermal, flux, structural, controls, and mechanical considerations. Flexibility allows one to readily adjust configuration. Provides additional distance between the hazard source (e.g. reactor flux, heat, ect.) and sensitive electronics. Allows for additional platforms that can improve shielding or employ additional components to influence mechanical performance. Operates as a readily implementable and replaceable unit and does not require intricate disassembly although individual capacity components are still readily accessible for performance optimization tuning and maintenance. Simple features allow for rapid manual or simple remote attachment/detachment methods. Allows separation between safety related (SR) and non-safety related (NSR) components, which enables efficient development of a robust control solution. Applications:?? Microreactors, particularly in isolated environments. General rotation motion systems with integrated tunable clutching, limits, continuous output position indication, damping, torque energy capture, and rapid passive homing. Development Status:? TRL 4.

Opportunity:?? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this thermal property measurement instrument. This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:??????? Rapid design and development of new materials for use in defense, energy, and electronics applications is increasingly dependent on high-throughput sample characterization. Large sets of material characterization data is necessary not only to make classical material optimization decisions but also to feed modern material design tools that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence. This technology, developed by researchers at INL, offers a new way to capture thermal properties of materials while the sample is in the chamber of multi-analytical materials analysis tools. Capturing thermal properties in a spatially localized manner in concert with direct evaluation of microstructures is not currently possible using state-of-the-art instruments. This instrument is designed as an add-on for currently operating materials analysis tools. Description:??? This technology is a compact, solid state, ultra-high vacuum compatible optical instrument designed to measure thermal properties in multi-analytical environments (e.g. TOF-SIMS, FIB, SEM, etc.). This solid-state instrument delivers laser light to the instrument head in a contained fashion using optical fibers. It is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum environments commonly encountered in multi-analytical materials characterization tools such as scanning electron microscopes. This technology allows for operating analytical tools to be retrofitted with new diagnostic capabilities for measuring thermal properties and new multi-analytical tools to be designed with this technology in mind. INL?s technology enables rapid and highly-spatially correlated measurements of multiple material properties. Research so far have measured material thermal properties key to applications ranging from nuclear fuel to turbine thermal barrier coatings, to power electronics. The ability to directly correlate these properties with highly local material microstructure will greatly reduce uncertainty in the understanding of structure-property relationships for materials under development. Benefits:??? ?????? Compatible with analytical systems from multiple major manufacturers. Allows for far greater variability of optical methods to be deployed compared to single-measure-type instruments currently deployed. Allows spatial mapping of thermal properties directly, rather than spatial measurements of resulting temperature fields. Applications:?? ? Materials evaluation and testing Rapid thermal analysis ?

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire an Inscopix nVue miniature microscope and its associated hardware for dual-color in vivo fluorescence imaging in the brains of behaving animals. This equipment will be critical for the central mission of the Integrative Neuroscience Section (INS) to study the neural basis of normal and disordered learning and memory processes. We are requesting this item to expand our capacity perform in vivo imaging experiments to assess cell-type specific function and connectivity in mouse brain. The nVue system allows for the simultaneous fluorescence imaging in two colors (green and red). This item is only available through Inscopix, and this particular upgrade is only available to us at the listed pricing because we acquired a different Inscopix microscope in the past. Also, we require this particular upgraded microscope to be consistent with our previous research using the previous model for scientific continuity. Purpose: Research in the INS probes the neural circuit basis of normal working memory, and characterizes the neural circuit and working memory dysfunction in mouse models of genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and related disorders. INS members use in vivo physiology to record the function of discrete cells and circuits in freely moving mice. INS focuses on understanding the neural computations within, and circuit-level interactions between, the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and thalamus of the mouse. The ability to conduct optical imaging of fluorescent indicators of neural activity in the brains of freely moving rodents is required for the research conducted in the INS. The nVue platform includes: 1. nVue microscope (fully integrated and assembled for immediate use) 2. DAQ box (allows for seamless communication with an external hardware device and coordinates or controls multiple devices during an experiment) 3. Inscopix Data Acquisition Software (software includes device control for two imaging LEDs in dual dynamic, dynamic-static, neurotransmitter, and blood flow imaging modes) 4. Commutator support (fully compatible with the Inscopix Commutator, an active, motorized solution for cable management during rodent behavior) 5. Inscopix Data Processing Software (software GUI is user-friendly, with options for customization) 6. ProViewTM Implant Kit (a specialized attachment device to hold lens during surgical procedures, includes stereotax rod, screw, adjustment tool, and instructions) 7. 5 baseplate covers, 1 dummy microscope, and support for Integrated ProView lens probes with pre-aligned baseplates (available in a variety of diameters or lengths of GRIN lens; straight or prism can be specified by the user) 8.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. ?It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. ?Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. ?No award will be made as a result of this notice. ?The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. ?This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background: ?NCATS has become a key partner in the Antiviral Program for Pandemics (APP), a multi-agency initiative that includes NIAID and BARDA, to accelerate antiviral development through early discovery and preclinical development of safe and effective oral antivirals. The initial priority for the APP is to develop treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, with the program expanding to address other virus families with pandemic potential. NCATS will apply its proficiency in drug discovery and development and its cutting-edge technologies to fill critical needs of the APP, such as (i) target validation, (ii) high-throughput screening (HTS) for drug starting points, (iii) medicinal chemistry for lead optimization, and (iv) preclinical, investigational new drug (IND)-enabling development. APP chemists within DPI are tasked with the discovery and development potential small molecule antiviral treatments for a range of viruses that have pandemic potential. In order to meet the increased demand for sample purification and analysis, the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) needs to improve throughput and expand capabilities through procurement of additional instrumentation and equipment, as well as the application of new technologies. Purpose and Objectives: Of all the chromatographic techniques and methods that the ACC has available, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is a technique that is not current employed for the analysis and purification of compounds synthesized by DPI medicinal chemists. SFC is a variant of normal-phase HPLC where supercritical CO2 is used as the mobile phase along with a cosolvent to modify polarity. The unique properties of the supercritical fluid enable chemical separations not readily possible with other chromatographic techniques. With the understanding that a limited number of chromatographic techniques cannot possibly purify all compounds, the ACC sees the incorporation of SFC into the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform as a means to expand purification capabilities and resolve operational issues. A bottleneck in the workflow is the removal of solvent after purification, which is a time-consuming process dependent on the volume and boiling point of the solvent. As we move to a more automated platform, a reduction in solvent removal time is needed to increase throughput and cycle time. SFC offers a convenient solution as CO2 is easily removed through rapid evaporation leaving behind pure material. An additional benefit of SFC is an increased sample load injection while still maintaining good separation efficiency enabling faster throughput or larger amounts of material. As such, the ACC is looking to expand its chromatography capabilities with the acquisition of a Waters ACQUITY UltraPerformance C2 SFC instrument with QDa for analytical analysis of compounds synthesized by APP, ETB, TDB, and CGB medicinal chemists within DPI.

In order to meet the increased demand for sample purification and analysis, the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) needs to improve throughput and expand capabilities through procurement of additional instrumentation and equipment, as well as the application of new technologies. Purpose and Objectives: The ACC provides analytical chemistry services involving the isolation, purification, identification, and analysis of therapeutic modalities for targeted disease states. This is accomplished through the development and usage of the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform. This workflow employs both Gilson and Waters semi-preparative liquid chromatography systems with a selection of preparative columns capable of purifying a wide range of small molecules and peptides. The Gilson platform utilizes UV-directed sample collection while the Waters platform employs both UV- and mass-directed detection and collection. The current Gilson purification system in the Bldg A Chemistry lab is over 10 yrs old and has been experiencing more severe malfunctions with increasing frequency. This has contributed to a greater backlog of samples and a decrease in productivity. The obsolete instrument needs to be replaced due to the increased service needs, longer down times, and an observed reduction in product recovery amounts. As such, the ACC requires the acquisition of a replacement purification system, specifically a Waters AutoPurification System with SQD2 MS Detector, which is the same Waters instrument employed in the Bldg C Chemistry lab. By utilizing the same instrumentation across all labs, we enable greater standardization and efficiency of the SMART Centralized Sample Purification and Processing Platform. Additionally, the redundancy of Waters AutoPurification systems will provide increased consistency with purification results, as well as allow better cross-coverage due to instrument familiarity by the chromatography chemists. The new purification system will provide higher robustness, greater performance, and increased capabilities for the purification of compounds synthesized by APP, ETB, TDB, and CGB medicinal chemists within DPI.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background:? Neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer?s disease, are diseases that greatly affect patients? quality of life and they often require the need of caregivers. The incidence of these devastating diseases is continuously increasing, affecting large number of elderly individuals and presenting an ever greater burden on society and caregivers. Currently, drugs that could effectively treat these diseases do not exist. Moreover, currently, the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases is mostly possible at their advanced stages, when symptoms are already pronunced and affect patients? daily functioning. Disease detection at earlier, especially, preclinical, stages would allow NIA to test preventive interventions, combine treatments and lifestyle adjusments that could potentially delay disease onset and slow down disease progression. Extracellular Vesicle are membranous nanoparticles (with sizes from 50 nm ? 300 nm) secreted by all healthy and diseased cells, including neurons in neurodegenerative diseases. NIA has pioneered the use of Extracellular Vesicle biomarkers isolated from blood. To be able to effectively isolate Extracellular Vesicle to discover novel biomarkers, NIA must seek out novel and advanced techologies. The field of Extracellular Vesicle biomarkers is fairly new is but developing at very fast pace, because of its tremendeus potential in disease prognosis and diagnosis. Regarding the detection of Extracellular Vesicles in blood and other biofluids and their isolation, NIA often finds currently available technologies not sensitive enough and even obsolete. The required Cell Sorter with nano-scale capabilities presents this next step that is needed in NIA?s current reaserch. NIA requires superior and advanced capabilities that are much needed by the labs and other NIA Intramural Research Program (IRP) labs investigating Extracellular Vesicles for their role in aging and age-associated diseases. Purpose and Objectives: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) investigates biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases found in Extracellular Vesicles (particles 50-150 nm in size) and isolated from patients? plasma. In order to separate, validate and characterize isolated Extracellular Vesicles, NIA requires an instrument that is capable of separating particles of that size and sorting Extracellular Vesicles based on fluorescent signal tags. As a laboratory that has pioneered the development of biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease using Extracellular Vesicles of neuronal origin, this instrument is needed for the next (more advanced) level of Alzheimer's disease diagnostics. Project requirements: Benchtop Cell Sorter with the following salient characteristics: Violet side scatter configuration: Option to configure detector array to collect side scatter signal from Violet (405 nm) laser. The configured channel (VSSC) can be utilized to better resolve nanoparticles. Scatter resolution: Scatter performance optimized for resolving nanoparticles (nm resolution range). Dynamic laser options for the excitation of multiple markers in single extracellular vesicles simultaneously: Violet, 405 nm Blue, 488 nm Yellow, 561 nm Red, 638 nm Dynamic array of band pass filters for the detection of multiple markers in single extracellular vesicles simultaneously: 405/10 675/30 450/45 690/50 525/40 710/50 585/42 712/25 610/20 780/60 660/10 High sensitivity in main channels used for the detection of fluorescent extracellular vesicles: FITC: <30 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-FITC) from the 488 nm laser. PE: <10 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-PE) from the 561 nm laser. APC: <25 molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF-APC) from the 638 nm laser. Low sample flow rates (10 ?L/min) for the detection of single extracellular vesicles under non-swarming conditions. Automated maintenance, analysis and sorting setup reducing the time of experimentation and allowing usage by researchers with no prior experience with flow cytometry after basic training. Sorting of scarce sub-populations of extracellular vesicles from complex biofluids will require long sorting times during which the instrument will be running unattended. Hence, the sorter should monitor sorting stability and protect the sorted sample when a clog is detected or if the sorting droplet is unstable. Also, the instrument should be capable of controlling the temperature to protect the sample during long sorting times.? Long sorting times will result in sorted samples with high volume. Hence, the sorter should have collection devices of high-volume capacity (e.g. multiple 5-15 mL tube holders). The instrument should be capable of sorting multiple sub-populations simultaneously (preferably more than three) with high purity. Quantity: 1 Delivery Date: 60 days after receipt of award. Other important considerations: In case domestic sources are available and capable of fulfilling the Government?s need, and a future solicitation is published, the Government will use evaluation preferences in accordance with FAR 25.

The statutory authority for this acquisition is 41 USC 3304(a)(1); FAR 13.106-1(b). ***** Sole source determination is based on the need to acquire one (1) tunable telecom laser with high-speed servo. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Physical Measurements Laboratory (PML), Optomechanics Group in the Microsystems and Nanotechnology Division, we do research involving photonic crystals for optomechanics.? This research involves designing and testing these optomechanical photonic crystals in order to optimize their optical and mechanical properties, most notably the optical reflectivity and the mechanical quality factor.? These optomechanical photonic crystals have applications including small force sensing, accelerometry, vacuum measurement, and quantum technologies, all of which are pursued at NIST.? In order to evaluate and make use of the optomechanical photonics crystals that we design and fabricate, we probe and drive them with laser light.? We design these photonic crystals to work at optical wavelengths in the telecom band (roughly 1500 nm ? 1600 nm) and use lasers to drive them and build these crystals into cavities with linewidths as low as 200 kHz and aim for even lower linewidth.? The cavities are probed with tunable, narrow-linewidth lasers and we lock the laser wavelength to the cavities by means of electronics.? The Division is in need of a newer tunable telecom-wavelength laser with a narrower linewidth and the ability for fast servo control in order to lock the laser to dynamic, narrow-linewidth optical cavities.? This is necessary to do research that is not limited by a laser source that dates to 2010.? The ?special? element here is the ability to control the laser frequency very rapidly in order to ?lock? the laser frequency with feedback to a rapidly-changing resonance of an optical cavity.? The linewidth of our optical cavities has become smaller and smaller, making the issue of locking a laser to the cavity resonances ever more challenging as our newest photonic-crystal cavities are so good that we are not able to lock our lasers to them at all. The key requirement is a 50 MHz bandwidth for control of the laser frequency; in addition, sophisticated computer-controlled electronics with the lowest possible latency times are critical for adequate servo performance.? Toptica is the only company that can offer a bandwidth of 50 MHz, signal latency below 10 ns, and a computer controller with three integrators and two differentiators.? Toptica Photonics, Inc is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the equipment that meets the required minimum specifications. *****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 ? Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. *****A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.? Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. ? *****No solicitation package will be issued.? This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing before the response date of this notice. Only responses received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on June 7, 2022 will be considered by the government. ?Responses shall be submitted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov or forest.crumpler@nist.gov"

The unique patented technology allows investigators in determining the cell morphology, cell health, movement and function of cell models, and in studying complex cell-cell interactions from hours to days over time by live cell imaging and analysis data in real-time. The automation of the IncyCyte S3 system is an required by the investigators as it allows acquiring and analyzing phase-contrast and fluorescence images of the cells without disturbing the cells or removing the cells from the incubator. The IncuCyte suite of applications will be used in areas of oncology, immune-oncology, immunology, neuroscience, aging, diabetes, drug discovery, and nanomedicine. Using the system, investigating various aspects of cell functions and behavior and response to treatment is feasible that could lead to developing novel therapeutics, and new areas of research. The equipment s unique design has a microscope with fixed sample stage that offers uninterrupted incubation of a range of cell types - from proliferating tumor cells to non-adherent immune cells to sensitive primary cells. The system is versatile and has interchangeable trays to accommodate tissue culture flasks, dishes, or multi-well plates. The IncuCyte S3 system allows the visualization (by phase-contrast and fluorescence) and monitoring of cell health and proliferation (eg: cell counting, apoptosis, tumor spheroid, cell-cycle, etc.); cell function (eg: phagocytosis, NETosis, angiogenesis, immune cell killing, neuronal activity, antibody internalization, etc.); cell movement and morphology (eg: scratch wound assay, cell migration and invasion, neurite outgrowth, immune cell activation, etc.); binding of biological and non-biological materials (drug, nanoparticle, cell-particle interaction, antibody binding to cell, etc.); measurement of receptor-mediated binding and entry into cells (nanoparticles, quantum-dots, virus, bacteria, metals, antibodies, etc.); and intracellular localization and trafficking (siRNA, plasmid DNA, nanoparticles, virus, bacteria, spores, etc.). All of these biological and functional activities can be captured in real-time using the time-lapse system and the data presented visually in image format and numerically in graphical format. The IncuCyte S3 system also includes the requisite software system for generating customer-specific protocols. Since the protocols can be automated, once the experiment in particular the time-lapse imaging starts, the user can walk-away from the instrument while the samples are being processed, which frees the user to perform other experiments or analyses. This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any responsible source who can provide an equivalent product with these features described above may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than May 23th, 4:30PM, EST.

It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor the website(s) for any information that may pertain to this RFI. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government and shall not be returned. 1.0 PURPOSE OF THIS RFI This RFI constitutes market research to help PM LI2S-MC, along with members of Deputy Commandant for Capability Development and Integration (DC, CD&I) and Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (DC, I&L) to solicit experience and input from industry to inform development of a long-range (FY26 + ~10 yrs) strategic technology requirements to modernize current Logistics Command and Control (LOGC2) capabilities and plan for future additions and enhancements. The scope of eventual potential contract(s) will include replacing outdated, interim logistics systems with deployable front-end capabilities to retrieve and transact with data from the Global Combat Support Services-Marine Corps (GCSS-MC); enable and expand supply and maintenance requests in a tactical environment; and plan for replacement of the GCSS-MC system by fiscal year 2032 (FY32). The results of this, and potential future, RFIs and industry days will inform a full-scope Capability-Based Analysis and subsequent Acquisition Program Strategies that will provide the basis for delivering LOGC2 capabilities acquisition in FY26 and beyond. It is anticipated that access to the following Government information systems will be required in the performance of this contract: Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE), Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) module in PIEE, and Government Furnished Property (GFP) module in PIEE. This RFI allows potential offerors to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their corporate capabilities and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its requirements and eventual acquisition strategy. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS QUESTIONS PM LI2S-MC may not respond to questions, as this announcement is for market research purposes only. However, any questions submitted may aid the PM LI2S-MC in the planning phase of the procurement. Answers will be provided at the LOGC2 Industry Day and posted to the original GPE after the Industry Day event. Any questions should be submitted via email to MCSC_PMLI2S@usmc.mil utilizing the questions submission file provided with the RFI (Microsoft Office 2010 or newer format). RFI questions or clarifications may be submitted before 10:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, 28 April 2022. It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure that submission is timely. SUBMISSION DIRECTIONS Responses may be submitted via email to MCSC_PMLI2S@usmc.mil. All attachments must be in Microsoft Office 2010 or newer format. The combined size of all attachments must not exceed 10 megabytes. Providing identification of attachments within the body of the message will allow verification of delivery. It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure that submission is timely. RFI submissions may be submitted before 10:00 a.m. ET on Monday, 6 June 2022. Proprietary Data The Government may use information received from this RFI to establish future requirements. Offerors deciding to submit competition sensitive or proprietary information bear sole responsibility for marking the information for appropriate safeguarding. RFI RESPONSES Scope of Technical and Programmatic Challenge The approved GCSS-MC system requirements date back to FY 2003, and describe capabilities suited to the existing Marine Corps organization and business system requirements. The intent was, and still is, that GCSS-MC would deliver a comprehensive system that would replace legacy and stand-alone logistics applications with a single source of truth.? While formal requirements exist, they were not informed by a Concept of Operations describing USMC logistics ?in the fight,? and they were developed prior to the existence of cloud and information technology ?as a service? capabilities. Additionally, the systems to be replaced have minimal or no formal requirements, and those that exist are, at best, requirements traceability matrices that were devised to support awarding of support and sustainment contracts. The Deputy Commandant for Capabilities Development and Integration (CD&I), supported by PM LI2S and Deputy Commandant for Installations and Logistics (I&L), has initiated a Critical Data Analysis (CDA) and Logistics Enterprise Information Architecture (LOG EIA) to support near- and long-term requirements to deliver information technology (IT) capabilities in support of Marines fighting the Near-Peer competitor in degraded environments as well as modernizing the Marine Corps APSR and Supporting Establishment operations. It is the intent that the CDA and LOG EIA will be enduring documents, to be reviewed regularly and updated as needed, to reflect evolving operations concepts and data exchange needs. Later in FY22, CD&I will embark on developing a Concept(s) of Operations and Capability-Based Assessment(s) that will detail one or more capability needs based on the results of the CDA and LOG EIA. The combined CDA, CBA and LOG EIA will provide the basis for FY26 budget initiatives to modernize LOGC2 IT, which the Program Office envisions pursuing a postmodern ERP strategy to enhance current capabilities until full replacement of GCSS-MC (FY32-35 timeframe) begins. Recognizing that industry has already faced and addressed many of the challenges ahead of the Marine Corps, information and recommendations to support Program Objective Memorandum, FY26 (POM 26) initiatives and supporting Acquisition planning are being solicited in this RFI. Page Restriction(s) There is no page restriction associated with this RFI. An executive summary of five pages or less should accompany each submission. Responses may include advertising or marketing information. Executive Summary (5 pages or less) Provide your company name, point of contact (POC), business size (large or small), socio-economic status for all North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes you operate under, Seaport NxG contract number, and/or any applicable GSA schedule numbers. Provide a capability statement based on the context of the technical challenges described in paragraphs 2.3.1 and well as 2.3.4. Provide any relevant material illustrating the company?s experience, including findings from referenced technology modernization or business process reengineering efforts. Technology and Technical Approach The Government intends to retire legacy non-GCSS-MC logistics information systems and replace them with modernized front-end capabilities that can access and transact with GCSS-MC in various tactical and non-tactical environments. In particular, the Marine Corps is interested in findings and recommendations relating to distribution, warehousing, networks, and transportation capacity planning PM LI2S-MC invites your assessment of the current environment and solicits white papers based on direct experience and lessons learned to describe the following. Technical approaches to modernizing large Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems using application program interfaces (APIs) as well as containerized, cloud, and platform/infrastructure/software as a service constructs. Technical considerations to help inform calculation of edge compute and mobile platforms in an austere, potentially disconnected, tactical environment. Areas of consideration for Business Process Engineering/Reengineering in support of technology insertion. Planning and contracting for Dev/Sec/Ops pipelines that can be established quickly to meet emerging requirements or budget ?plus-ups.? Considerations to ensure Acquisition and Lifecycle Support cost estimates are comprehensive, including affordability alternatives. Areas of technology, performance or other trades pace to support development of budget initiatives and associated scenarios. Considerations and approaches for eventual replacement (FY32) of GCSS-MC in its current form with a modern, containerized/cloud-enabled system of systems that can support operations from a well-connected Supporting Establishment to a disconnected tactical environment. RFI Feedback (No page restriction) Was the combination of this RFI and the information delivered at Industry Day sufficient to devise a response? Are there any objectives not described in this RFI that would enhance the content and relevance of industry responses? Are there potential technical approaches that we should consider in addition to those detailed in paragraph 2.3.4, subparagraph i. What performance risks should be considered when articulating requirements? If the Government determines additional RFIs and/or industry days are warranted to support further requirement development, what would you recommend they be? INDUSTRY DAY The PM LI2S-MC will host an industry day on Tuesday, 3 May 2022, at Quantico Corporate Center, just outside of Marine Corps Base Quantico (MCBQ), Virginia. All interested parties are highly encouraged to attend. The intent of the industry day is to deliver a comprehensive description of current LOGC2 capabilities and challenges and to present the Program Manager?s vision for LOGC2 capability modernization planning and describe the information and recommendations being solicited from industry.

In addition, there are at times, a need to request a portable restroom to be delivered as soon as possible due to unforeseen circumstances. The Park Operations division often operates emergency warming centers and cooling centers within the City of Sacramento. For emergency operations of these centers, units would need to be delivered same-day.

This is a countywide contract, but the main users are Community Development Department (Code Enforcement) and the Department of Finance, Tax Collection and Licensing Division. The required reports would be equivalent to a Litigation Guarantees Report or Trustee Sale Guarantees Report.  However, the County of Sacramento does not require title insurance and is not requesting a formal Ligation Guarantee or Trustee Sale Guarantee.  

The contract resulting from this RFP shall be for an initial two -year period commencing with execution of the contract by the Contract and Purchasing Services.  For reasons of economy and efficiency, the County reserves the right to extend a contract three additional one-year periods, for a total of five years, upon mutual agreement between the County of Sacramento and the contractor.

The Department of Finance, Tax Collector and Licensing requires Party of Interest Reports on a batch of properties prior to their annual tax sales.  Number of reports varies significantly depending on the actual defaults for the annual sale.  The quantity has ranged in from as low as 60 properties up to 400 properties.  The Tax Collector submits these properties in one major batch each year, with the potential of one or more smaller requests at different times of the year.

Code Enforcement requires weekly Party of Interest Reports on properties.  Most requests are single properties, but sometimes include 2 or 3 properties.  Code Enforcement conducts an annual lien hearing, which could include 65 properties.  

These volumes listed above are estimates only for planning purposes.  The County may require more or less reports during any contract year and does not guarantee to request a minimum number of reports for any resulting contract.

CCDC understands that this project can serve the community with a meaningful commercial program on the ground floor and provide much-needed affordable housing for underserved seniors of all races reflective of the diversity of the City. The major challenge of the project is to achieve a financially feasible residential program on the sites small footprint. Additionally, it will be important to bring a creative approach to finding a balance between designing a thriving commercial program and re-introducing the cultural heritage of the banquet hall. New Asia is one of the last remaining banquet halls, and it was a popular social, civic, and political gathering hub for over three decades. The design team has the exciting challenge of bringing about a transformative difference to a culturally rich and historic neighborhood.

The developers vision for 772 Pacific is to create a mixed-use senior residential community of more than 86 deeply affordable studio and one-bedroom units, subject to SF Plannings feasibility determination and the project budget that MOHCD approves. We seek to create a high-quality living environment for senior households whose incomes will range between 30% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI up to 60% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI with more than half of the units for seniors with incomes at or below 30% MOHCD Unadjusted SF AMI. Our development will include on-site property management and resident services, front desk reception at the entry lobby, a community room for programing and events, and a neighborhood-friendly commercial component. As a rare new development, 772 Pacific will provide a tranquil refuge for seniors from Chinatowns busy streets below while providing an opportunity for seniors to age in place with dignity. Along with the housing, responding to stakeholder input regarding the ground floor commercial use will be an integral part of the work; it is important that the project maximize affordable housing while also continuing to host a community-sustaining ground floor use.

The successful General Contractor firm(s) will demonstrate its ability to participate in a series of meetings with the developer and the design team throughout the design phases to proactively provide input on innovative building components and constructability of design for cost effective, streamlined solutions.

(2)Scope of Work for RFP: 
The developer is estimating hard construction cost around $ 60MM, which is subject to change depending on the scale of the building. 
Selected General Contractor shall provide input on the following: 
	The team is interested in exploring emerging construction technologies that will allow the site to be developed in a cost-effective manner while balancing durability and facilitating maintenance. 
o	We will not rule out any system before understanding the cost, site, and staging implications. 
	Units are stacked for structural efficiency and seismic safety. 
	Recommendations for efficient residential unit layout and MOD-complying bathroom and kitchen configurations.
	Investigate and incorporate building dimensioning to:
o	Facilitate zero or reduced waste during construction,
o	Facilitate the inclusion of prefabricated walls and floor areas that can be efficiently craned and dropped-in-place during construction.
	Incorporate floor plans and exterior building envelope that can be efficiently built timewise and construction-wise. 
o	Establish an efficient ratio between window area and exterior wall area.
	Establish efficient floor-to-floor heights. Building will comply with the all-electric Code requirements.
	Plumbing is laid out for efficiency of plumbing runs
	Solar power and/or other natural resources to decrease hot water heating and other energy costs 
	Residential amenities to explore urban agricultural opportunities 
	In addition to achieving the minimum sustainability standards of TCAC and CDLAC, CCDC is interested in exploring Passive House design standards.
	Dos and Donts  Lessons learned from other affordable housing and/or MOHCD projects.

For purposes of this RFP, please indicate how long your team believes construction would last for this project. Please refer to the above schedule to inform your construction timeline.

This public advertisement constitutes the DRPAs formal solicitation to determine the interest of qualified firms in the Project.

The Scope of Services the Authority requires shall include construction monitoring services for the replacement and elimination of various power, signal, and communications cables running primarily within the Philadelphia tunnel of the PATCO system as well as traction-power equipment within Locust Street Substation, located in the area of the PATCO tunnel, below the concourse level and directly under Locust Street, immediately west of Broad Street, in Philadelphia.  The interested Construction Monitoring firm shall be note that the equipment replacements at Locust Street Substation represent a significant logistical challenge and that the firm will need to coordinate the work with PATCO and the Contractor to be completed successfully and without significant disruptions to PATCOs operations.  Multi-pair copper communications cable, the use of which has diminished significantly over the years at PATCO, will be eliminated, and any communications currently carried over copper cables will be moved to existing fiber optics.  The use of multi-conductor signal cable will be reduced by converting relay-based vital signaling to microprocessor-based vital signaling, placing signal communications between instrument locations onto existing fiber optics.  In addition to electrical portion of the project, the firm will also be involved with monitoring structural repairs to PATCOs Philadelphia tunnel.  Work will involve concrete repairs, type 1 and 2 spall repairs, crack injections, steel repairs, steel painting, and column repairs.  The electrical and structural portions of this project will be performed in PATCOs Philadelphia subway tunnel which runs 1.75 miles from 17th and Locust streets to the Front Street substation beneath the Benjamin Franklin Bridge."

Their use and incorporation in the development of this update to the Strategy is now emphasized and intended to ensure greater consistency in addressing and implementing regional threat and hazard priorities. This conscious and active use of the THIRA/SPR to inform the Strategy will also ensure that the regional estimates, impacts, outcomes and evaluation based on the FEMA core capabilities that these documents describe and project are more consistently reflected in the Strategy, and as a result of collaboration and coordination among the regions homeland security stakeholders. The selected contractor will also continue to incorporate, as necessary, the risk analysis tools that have been used previously in the development of the Strategy (e.g., Cal COP products, liaison with appropriate LECC staff, and use of specialized OES maintained data bases that can all provide important inputs to the Strategy (e.g., SEAR and CIKR databases used and accessed by OES).

Solicitation Description:
Cameron County requests qualifications from engineering, architectural and consulting firms (collectively, Consultants) interested in providing professional services to conduct post-hurricane/disaster damage assessment as part of the Countys overall Post-Hurricane Recovery Operations.  The County recognizes that immediately after a major disaster, local firms might not be able to respond quickly to a request for services.  As a result, the County is interested in contracting with firms both in the local area and outside the local area to ensure that an adequate resource base is available regardless of the extent of damage within the County.  This contract shall cover calendar years 2022 through 2027.



The concept for post-hurricane recovery operations is for the County to have a number of pre-event contracts in place that will provide personnel to assist local government staffs with damage assessment activities immediately after a hurricane or other disaster.  Damage Assessment Teams (DATs) will be comprised of government and Consultant personnel under the overall direction of Cameron County staff.  The work will entail preliminary assessment and documentation of the scope and nature of damage incurred throughout the County in accordance with direction and guidance provided by the County.  The work will also include detailed documentation of damage to public property and facilities.  The work may also include assistance with repair plans and specifications and/or assistance with monitoring contractors involved in emergency protective measures.  The County will provide necessary training on the assessment process and completion of the associated forms and records.



It is the County's intent to identify qualified Consultant firms, enter into an agreement with each qualified firm, and be able to activate as many firms as necessary to provide prompt damage assessment services immediately following a hurricane or other disasters. The unpredictable nature of hurricanes or other disasters precludes providing more detailed descriptions of the actual work assignments at this time.



The primary focus of the pre-positioned contracts is post-hurricane and other /disaster recovery operations.  Notwithstanding, the County may activate the same contracts for response to any disaster, natural or man-made, regardless of the scope of damage.  The County may contact any of the Consultants under contract at any time for assistance in this area.  The intent is that the firm will provide personnel to the extent of their capabilities at the time of the request.  Submitters should consider this concept."

Bid Description: Tourism is one of the largest economic sectors in Vermont, welcoming over 13 million visitors each year who account for close to $3 billion in annual spending on lodging, food and drink, goods, and services. While Summertime is the busiest time of year for tourism, Vermont is a four-season destination for domestic and international visitors. The state is famous around the world for its beautiful fall foliage colors, when tourists flock to Vermonts byways to enjoy the spectacular change of seasons. During the winter months, Vermonts world class ski resorts are the most popular destination in the Northeast for skiing and riding. In springtime, Vermont is consistently the top producer of maple syrup in the country. The current website hosts over 1.2M sessions and over 2M page views on a yearly basis. Most visitors to the site are new users, to the tune of about 900K new users every year. We estimate that the site currently includes approximately 750+ pages and the site library includes over 2000 images. VermontVacation.com has been in its current state since transitioning to a mobile friendly solution in 2013. Prior to this, the site remained in Sitecore as a desktop site. The current implementation is limited by VDTM team access to css, layouts, and other functionalities necessary for digital marketing. Through this Request for Proposal (RFP), the Agency of Digital Services on behalf of the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing (hereinafter the State) is seeking to establish contracts with one or more companies to plan, design, deploy, host, and provide ongoing support for a new website implementation of VermontVacation.com that inspires visitation to the state of Vermont. If you are interested in submitting a bid, please go to the following web site: http://bgs.vermont.gov/purchasing-contracting/bid-info Here you will find the bid documents ready to be downloaded. PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT ALL NOTIFICATIONS, RELEASES AND AMENDMENTS WILL BE POSTED HERE. THE STATE WILL MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO CONTACT VENDORS WITH UPDATED INFORMATION. IT WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH VENDOR TO PERIODICALLY CHECK THIS SITE FOR THE LATEST DETAILS.

Project Name: Abandoned Property Registration Program - Annual

Scope of Work: 1.1. Lee County Board of County Commissioners seeks to contract with a qualified Vendor to administer an Abandoned Property Registration Program.

1.2. The purpose of this project is to establish an electronic registration process to limit and reduce the deterioration of property located within unincorporated Lee County, as contemplated by Lee County Ordinance 13-18. The mortgagee of a distressed property is required to register the property with the County.  A property is distressed if it is under mortgage default; under a notice of mortgagees sale or pending sale has been the subject of a mortgage foreclosure sale where title is retained by the mortgagee; or title has been transferred to a mortgagee under deed-in-lieu of foreclosure sale, short sale, or any other legal means.  This registration program is a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance, or through distressed and/or abandoned properties that are subject to mortgages in default.

Operational Description The Army plans to continue modernization of the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS).? AFATDS provides the Army and Marine Corps automated fire support command, control and communications and is used to plan, execute, and deliver lethal and non-lethal effects and provides Joint/Coalition Situational Awareness for fires execution and mission management. The system interoperates and integrates with over 80 different battlefield systems, including Navy and Air Force command and control weapons systems. As a member of the Artillery System Cooperation Agreement (ASCA), AFATDS is interoperable with coalition partner fire support systems. The currently fielded AFATDS 6.8 baseline automates the planning, coordination, and control of all fire support assets (field artillery, mortars, close air support, naval gunfire, attack helicopters, offensive electronic warfare, fire support meteorological systems, forward observers, and fire support radars).? AFATDS 7.0 (currently under development) transitions the Ada backend to Java and will provide improved cyber security, embedded training, a refreshed UI and backend improvements which will simplify sustainment and maintenance.? ?AFATDS 7.1 will expand on the benefits provided by AFATDS 7.0 by providing more robust front end changes, expanded embedded training, various sensor to shooter enhancements, and support for next generation munitions and additional backend changes for improved maintainability Requirements PM MC is seeking responses from interested parties that provide insights into how industry may go about meeting the AFATDS requirements as described within this RFI. Specific areas that responses should focus on are as follows: Opportunities and options for alignment with the Command Post Computing Environment Architectural changes to AFATDS to better support cloud computing hosting options Decomposition of key AFATDS functionality to be exposed as microservice based containers to improve overall system modularity and maintainability Backwards Compatibility with prior versions of AFATDS Improved usability to user facing interfaces Embedded training of key software features to provide 24/7/365 access to training IPV6 support Resolve known issues within AFATDS MIL-STD-2525D compliance Incorporating new munitions within AFATDS Applicable intellectual property/data rights related factors associated with proposed paths forward should be highlighted as part of all responses.

As a result, USACE contracting offices that are currently using other file drop services (e.g., DoD SAFE) are beginning to discontinue the use of these tools and beginning to transition to the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE) Solicitation Module.? This capability allows USACE to have a more automated and secure process for capturing solicitations and their attachments and responses from industry.? PIEE?s Solicitation Module enables posting of solicitations to a widespread or restricted audience. This includes the ability to post draft or final solicitations, amendments, and attachments. Government users can designate either the entire solicitation or specific attachments as limited to use by specific companies. Contractors are able to submit their proposals via the portal, and contracting personnel are then able to use the portal to distribute proposals to reviewers. In preparation for full implementation of the PIEE Solicitation Module, we recommend that all Contractors doing business with USACE access the PIEE Solicitation Module Vendor Access Instructions (https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/docs/PIEE/PIEE_Solicitation_Module_Vendor_Access_Instructions.pdf) and either self-register for a PIEE account and add the appropriate roles, or for existing PIEE users, access their account and add additional roles.? There are two vendor roles (Proposal Manager, Proposal View Only) for the PIEE Solicitation Module. The Proposal Manager role is required to submit an offer to a solicitation posted in the PIEE Solicitation Module.? Further details are provided not only in the Vendor Access Instructions but also via PIEE's Web Based Training module (https://pieetraining.eb.mil/wbt) under the ?Award? heading and ?Solicitation? link (https://pieetraining.eb.mil/wbt/xhtml/wbt/sol/index.xhtml).? In addition, please be advised that when using the PIEE Solicitation Module, the user?s e-mail address in PIEE must match the e-mail address on file in SAM.gov. Specific instructions on offer submission using the PIEE Solicitation Module will be included in solicitations that require the use of said tool.? The purpose of this special note is to alert potential Contractors of upcoming changes in USACE?s electronic submission process and ensure they are not only registered in PIEE but also have the appropriate roles."
