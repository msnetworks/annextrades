The Offeror shall identify and complete the past performance survey requirement for a minimum of two (2) and maximum of five (5) contracts/task orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance. Recent is defined as within the last three years from solicitation close date. Relevant is defined as any contract or subcontract valued at similar magnitude or greater. Same or similar requirement is defined as design, fabricate, and delivery and installation a modular building for healthcare use, and configuration of Floor Plans, Furniture, Cabling, Equipment, Electrical, HVAC, etc. Project experience reflects whether contractors have performed similar/same work before. Past performance describes how well the contractor performed the work and the Past Performance Survey shall include the following information and the Offeror may complete the information below only on the questionnaires to reduce the administrative burden of the references: ? Project title; ? Description of the project; ? Contract number; ? Contract amount; ? Government Agency/Organization; ? COR?s & CO?s name, address, and phone number; ? Current status, e.g., completed and/or if in progress, start and estimated completion dates; and ? A brief narrative of why you deem the reference to be relevant to this effort. 5 of 10 The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources. Past performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractor?s past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort. The Contractor shall submit the past performance questionnaire surveys (Attachment 1) to the references. The references should submit those surveys directly back to the Government via email (dekovan.cook@ihs.gov) by the close date of this solicitation. If the Offeror submits surveys that have already been completed, the Government shall immediately discard and ignore them, and re-survey those references. Since the Contractor will submit the past performance questionnaire survey directly to their references for completion, it should be returned directly from the reference to the Government by the quote submission date. Element 2. Relevant Past Performance evaluation via Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). PPIRS records for the identified contract under element 1 will be assessed and other records within PPIRS may be considered. No submission is required for this element. PRICE QUOTE (Volume 2) Element 1. The price quote shall be a separate volume from your technical and past performance volume. The price quote is to be submitted as a Firm Fixed Price quote and may be in the Offeror?s preferred format. Excel worksheets shall have working cells and formulas, and be rounded to no more than 2 decimal places. It is critical for the Offeror to acknowledge that the Technical Drawings and Specifications Manual provided in the attachments J01b and J01c are the Government?s estimate and for informational purpose only. It is the Offeror?s responsibility to analyze, calculate and determine the final product within the required specifications in its Firm-Fixed-Price offer. In accordance with the FAR 16.202-1 - A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor?s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties. Therefore, it is highly encouraged for the offerors to attend the scheduled site visits and ask as many questions as possible to clarify the requirement and reduce any assumptions. No assumptions will be accepted under the RFQ and Offeror?s quote may be disqualified by the Government if the CO determines an Offeror?s proposed assumption brings too much of performance/cost risks to the government. Element 2. Offerors shall submit a price breakdown and/or crosswalk with its firm-fixed-price offer. The information shall allow the government evaluators to comprehend the Labor and Material the Offeror is proposing to accomplish the project. Furthermore, the price quote shall include any BOM that the Offeror has developed for the project. An overview summary of the BOM is required and the summary must identify any contractor proposed BOM areas that are notably differ from the government estimated product with a narrative for the difference(s). Offerors shall provide price per unit of items on the BOM exceeding $10,000. All other items may be rolled up into your quote. Redacted Versions of the labor-mix and BOM without pricing information are also required. 6 of 10 TRIBAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OFFICE (TERO): TERO Ordinances require that all employers who are engaged in operating a business on reservations give preference to qualified Indians in all aspects of employment, contracting and other business activities. TERO Offices were established and empowered to monitor and enforce the requirements of the tribal employment rights ordinance. Aspects of this requirement may require a TERO Business License; it is incumbent of the vendor to include all applicable TERO requirements in their quote.

EVALUATION GENERAL The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses management approach, technical capabilities, installation schedule, personnel qualification, and organizational experience), past performance and price factors. Technical and Past Performance when combined are more important than price. All non-price factors are of equal importance. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government. Offerors are advised that award will be made to that Offeror whose quote provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining technical and performance capability superiority rather 8 of 10 than lowest overall price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall price to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as quotes become more equal based on other factors. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of requirements of the RFQ. EVALUATION FACTORS The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical Capabilities, (2) Delivery - Design, Fabrication, Delivery, and Installation Schedule (3) Key Personnel Qualifications and Management Plan (4) Relevant Past Performance (5) Price PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE Contract performance shall commence on date of contract award and once a notice to proceed is issued. CONTRACT AWARD Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government. Offerors should be aware that the Government shall perform a ?best value analysis? and the selection for award shall be made to the Offeror whose quote is most advantageous to the Government. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government. MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE PERIOD ?Acceptance period,? as used in this provision, means the number of calendar days available to the Government for awarding a contract from the date specified in this solicitation for receipt of proposals. This provision supersedes any language pertaining to the acceptance period that may appear elsewhere in this solicitation.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

Your response to this notice must be received on or before 10:00 AM Pacific Time on May 3, 2022.? Summary of Scope of Work:? The current Walla Walla Headquarter Building has been in use for about 27 years after the original Walla Walla Headquarters relocated to the new building in 1995. The firestopping measurements put in place during the original construction of the building are critical to the safety of personnel, as such measures keep fire and smoke out of certain designated areas. The FY21 inspection revealed several rooms in the HQ building have insufficient firestopping measures and can?t meet the 1-hour rating requirements. Ducts, piping, conduit, and wires are improperly sealed as they penetrate horizontally through walls and vertically through ceilings. Some penetrations allow smoke to pass through and in other cases can?t withstand fire for the necessary duration. The work to be performed as part of this requirement would include making the neccessary firestopping upgrades to get the building up to date.?"

This effort is for precision manufactured parts, CNC programming, design and feasibility reviews, and educational instruction in support of Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Graduate School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (GSEAS). GSEAS research is often based on theoretical capability and the components under consideration are one-of-a-kind items. The proposed support services must also include face-to-face manufacturing, feasibility, and educational instruction from a master machinist located within 30 miles of NPS. The facility, and the expert machinists, must be in close-proximity to GSEAS students to provide real-time, hands-on instruction in the methods and best practices for limited rate production manufacturing. Typical projects include machined parts associated with rocket, propulsion, and combustion engines. This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to Inter City Manufacturing Inc. in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor, Inter City, is the only known source in Monterey, CA that can provide the manufacturing and related educational services necessary to advance GSEAS student research. Note: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any capability statements received within five business days after date of publication of this synopsis (NLT 7:00 AM PST on Wed 04/13/2022) will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

These magnets will be used to bend and focus high energy and high intensity electron beams in the EIC rapid cycling electron synchrotron ring (RCS) and the EIC electron storage ring (ESR). Both TJNAF and BNL will be responsible for the final design, procurement, and quality assurance of different magnet families for the EIC project. EIC can refer to either lab with respect to the magnet procurements. BNL will be responsible for the final installation and commissioning of the magnets in the EIC complex. While it is anticipated installation and commissioning will primarily be a BNL responsibility, JLab and our satellite system supplier(s) will certainly have some involvement in those phases as well to ensure the proper installation and startup of the magnets. This combined pre-solicitation notice, sources sought request and request for information (RFI) communication is a critical first step in our path to success. Its intent is to bring our industry partners into the loop as early in the process as possible prior to release of any formal requests for proposal(s) (RFP) that we anticipate releasing in the next 12 to 24 months. As you will see from the questions we will be posing, we would like industry to have some input into the process with potential influence on the strategy, specifications, and supporting documentation as they get finalized prior to any RFP(s). The RFI package can be found at the following link on the JLab Solicitation Bulletin Board: https://misportal.jlab.org/ul/bus_ops/ Please register interest to ensure you receive automatic updates to the RFI posting."

This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to obtain information for planning purposes only. Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? Rather, the purpose of this RFI is to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.? A determination by the Government not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. BACKGROUND: The Air Force (AF) has need to modernize the HVAC Purge/Flush Process and Equipment used to maintain MMIII in addition to the transition to the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ??The AF would like to obtain information to understand if processes and equipment are available and obtainable. The purpose of this RFI is two-fold. The first purpose is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be a full and open competition and/or a total small business set-aside.? The Government is looking at several North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) codes; 238220 HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-condition) contractors or 423730 HVAC equipment merchant wholesales. ?If an alternate NAICS code is recommended, please provide the recommendation in the response.? The AF is interested in all businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns.? The AF requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable, and identify your business status to the identified NAICS code (see the Section labeled ?Responses? for response requirements).? Additionally, please provide any potential teaming arrangements.? Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The second purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about schedule, cost, and other aspects of this potential procurement from the perspectives of development and implementation. DESCRIPTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) maintains ICBM?s in the northern United States. In an effort to establish greater warfighter capabilities multiple systems are capable of initiating ICBM launches. The Brine Chiller Purge is used to ensure the HVAC equipment will be sufficient to sustain MMIII and through the transition to GBSD through acquisition (and modification as needed) of required equipment. The legacy/current process and equipment for evacuating and dehydrating, checking the refrigerant pressure, and reclaiming and servicing the LF and MAF Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-systems are using these available industry parts: Yellow Jacket (PN21012) oil changing pump SPX Robinair Vacuum Pump (PN 15600) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Reclaimer (PN 17800B) SPX Robinair Refrigerant Receiver Tank (PN 17121) The process, in conjunction with using the parts listed above, takes maintenance technicians an average 3-5 days to complete.? A bench checkout on the Brine Chiller is conducted post servicing the Brine Chiller Refrigerant sub-system.? CAPABILITIES:? Field and/or Apprentice Technician level and/or skill set Basic HVAC Principle Training focus on ECS and EPA regulation List hazardous and/or flammable materials List of general, specialty, and/or sole source equipment and materials Vacuum operating level maximum must be below and hold below 500 Microns no less than 5-minutes; no minimum level purge or holding requirement Overall timeline for completing process must be less than 3-days with a bench check? process ideally less than but no more than 4 hours (i.e. 2-hours under low heat load and 2-hours under high heat load) Operating procedures and/or user?s manual ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUESTED: Provide a schedule from contract award through qualification and implementation Provide an estimate cost range as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) from contract award through qualification and implementation. RESPONSES: Responsible and capable sources may identify their interest by providing a white paper capability statement (limited to 10 pages) with sufficient information to substantiate respondents have all of the capabilities listed in Capabilities and answering all questions. ?Please see the section for Eligibility Requirement. Government will consider responses to one or all of the purposes depending on company?s capability. ADDITIONAL NOTICES: Neither the release of this RFI nor any responses to it guarantee a solicitation will be issued.? A determination by the AF not to compete this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the AF. ?The AF will not pay for either the effort or the associated costs to respond, or for any information provided.? ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT: The distribution of the draft specification and top level drawings is limited to contractors with a DD 2345 certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service, Joint Certification Program (1-877-352-2255) and who have a legitimate business purpose. As such, WBS cannot be provided to a contractor without a certification. Contractors who would like to become certified can find the form and instructions at: https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/default.aspx.

Interested companies with the technologies capable of meeting the desired general requirements may submit responses that include products current and expected capabilities with modifications. This RFI is not a request for proposal and the Government will reimburse no costs associated with response to this RFI. B.?? ?BACKGROUND The US Navy is seeking information on the industry capabilities for inspection system of a small diameter pipe (1? ? 6?). ?This pipe will be referred to as a guide or stowage tube, and is part of a system that a Towed Array travels through on deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection systems major components would consist of a user control system, inspection device, and cable storage. ?This system would need to be portable so it could be deployed and setup pier side to access the entry point on the vessel. ?Power would be provided by a battery and/or use standard 120 VAC 60Hz power. ?The maximum working length needed to inspect a guide or stowage tube will account for distance from system user control station to entry of guide or stowage tube. ?Diver support would be used to assist the inspection effort and access the guide or stowage tube entry point. ?Due to limitations of access, an inspection device using internal sensors is preferred, as clearance for external sensors is limited. ?Along the inspection run, the inspection device must traverse a minimum bend radius. ?These bend radius sections are through roller box assemblies, which consist of rollers made of Delrin, which reduce friction through these turns during deployment and retrieval cycles. ?The inspection device would need to be waterproof and operate in a marine environment (regular immersion in salt water). ?This desired inspection device must be able to provide visual and measurement data of reasonable resolution in real time via a user control station and save this data for post analysis using a removable storage device. ?Accurate measurement would be expected for the following conditions of the stowage or guide tube: ?submerged in saltwater, partially submerged, or empty. ?Data collection is expected to be completed in a work day (8-12 Hrs.), for the required length of guide or stowage tube. ?The systems provided software program can be used to view visual and measurement data in real time. ?The location of the inspection device would be tracked and used to mark locations of interest for post analysis. ?This program could also be used to export data to commonly available software using removable storage media. ?For post analysis, standalone PC software is used to analyze ?raw? data from inspection system to generate a CAD file or inspection report. The small diameter pipe is part of either a Thinline or Fatline Towed Array Handling System (TAHS). ?Where the pipe is referred to as a guide tube in a Thinline system, and stowage tube in a Fatline system. ?The primary differences between these two systems is working length, pipe diameter, minimum bend radius, and presence of roller boxes. ?Requirements will be separated for inspection of each handing system, however there is interest in an inspection system capable of meeting the combined requirements of each handling system. Authorized personnel will provide feedback and any technical data necessary to facilitate responses on industry capabilities. C.?? ?REQUIREMENTS The following are the requirements of the inspection system: ? See Attached Thinline Guide Tube Inspection Requirements See Attached Fatline Stowage Tube Inspection Requirements 1.

Castro Station Elevator
Scope of Work: As part of a larger San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) system-wide effort to improve accessibility of the MUNI subway system, the Castro Station will undergo several upgrades in and around the station area to improve ADA access to the station and transit services. The Castro Station Elevator Project will add a second elevator to the station to provide continuous access to the station and trains. The 4-stop elevator design includes a translucent etched pattern on clear laminated glass faade to provide unobstructed sightline into the elevator cab to improve rider safety. To create a safer and ADA compliant paths of travel, the brick paving area around the station entrance at street and Concourse levels will be regraded. A portion of the sidewalk on Market Street will be made wider, and new curb ramps will be added at Market and Collingwood Streets. The existing plaza lighting will be replaced, the terraces at the Concourse level will be re-planted, and new fences and bench will be installed.

The time allowed for completion is 600 consecutive calendar days. The estimated construction cost is approximately $12,000,000.

Air and Gas Compressor Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,000 employees. ?The Product Service Code is 4310 ? Compressors and Vacuum Pumps. Statement of Work Oxygen (O2) Generation Systems: a. Provide modular pressure/vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems of capacities as identified below. Units shall come with stand-alone controls, piping, conduit, blowers, vacuum pumps, compressors or boosters, tanks gauges, sensors and mass flow meters. Controls shall accept input and provide output per below. These new modular pressure/vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems would tie into existing modular vacuum swing adsorption oxygen generating systems. b. Oxygen is supplied to the system with on-site oxygen generators. These generators move filtered air through an adsorption bed resin or molecular sieve that removes nitrogen, leaving concentrated gaseous oxygen and the inert gas argon. Movement through the bed is at a low pressure with a vacuum cycle used to regenerate the beds by removing adsorbed nitrogen. The oxygen content supplied from the beds is monitored and the beds are pulsed to regenerate the resin. c. The oxygen gas coming from the generators will be between 90% and 95% oxygen content during normal operation with sufficient pressure to be injected into the pressurized Speece cones. The only oxygen storage provided is in buffer tanks to equalize pressure as the generators cycle through regeneration. The existing system has one oxygen buffer tank per operating generator. d. The oxygen generator shall have an integrated PLC and communicate with the main Dissolved Oxygen Injection System PLC via ethernet using MODBUS/TCPIP architecture, or natively speak to Allen Bradley COMPAC Logix 5000 via ethernet without conversion software.? PLC communication capabilities shall allow for supervisory control and monitoring of all data points and alarms monitored by the local PLC.? Supervisory control shall allow for editable startup/shut down sequences allowing for customizable delay times between sequence steps.?
