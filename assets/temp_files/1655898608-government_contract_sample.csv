The Air Force Lifecycle Management Center, Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Chief Architect Integration Office (CAIO) releases the Broad Agency Announcement for Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Announcement Number: BAA-AFLCMC_CAIO-2020-0001 Issue Date: 28 February 2020 NOTE This is only an announcement; PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE. Subsequent calls will be issued under this announcement to solicit proposals for specific efforts. Please refer to the attachment section of this announcement for the calls.? Publication of this announcement does not obligate the DoD to review any white papers submission beyond an initial administrative review, or to award any specific project, or to obligate any available funds. Executive Summary In order to effectively engage peer and near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Air Force needs to develop, acquire and operate systems as a unified force across all domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum).? The Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (DAFRCO) in partnership with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Architecture and Integration Directorate (AFLCMC/XA) seeks to develop a cross-cutter portfolio of complimentary/ linked projects and programs to support Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). The Air Force intends to facilitate the rapid exploration and maturation of innovative?technologies. The Air Force will support future operations by providing the critical surveillance, tactical edge communications, processing, networking, and battle management command and control capabilities to the joint warfighting force.? ABMS is not envisioned as a single program of record, but rather an open architecture family of systems that enables capabilities via multiple integrated platforms.? ABMS will realize the vision of JADC2 to enhance and expand capabilities by enabling any sensor to inform any shooter in any domain?land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. ?In an interview with Air Force Magazine in April 2019, General Goldfein stated, ?It is a significant move for the Air Force to shift from a platform solution on command and control and battle management to a network solution going forward, and our future in the business of joint warfighting is to ensure that we?re taking every sensor and every shooter and connecting them together to overwhelm an adversary?.? Our aim is to have intelligence and targeting data transformed into timely and actionable information through trusted networks and intelligent algorithms that enable our people to focus on decisions.? In this construct, information is a service, rather than a platform, and the layers of sensing and the communication pathways will provide reliability and assurance in contested environments. General Information Federal Agency Name:? AFLCMC/XA Broad Agency Announcement Title:??Advanced Battle Management System Broad Agency Announcement Type:? This is the initial announcement. Broad Agency Announcement Number:? BAA-AFLCMC_CAIO-2020-0001 Closing Date:?This BAA will remain open for 5 years until 27 February 2025, unless superseded, amended, or cancelled.

The Air Force Lifecycle Management Center, Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Chief Architect Integration Office (CAIO) releases the Broad Agency Announcement for Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Announcement Number: BAA-AFLCMC_CAIO-2020-0001 Issue Date: 28 February 2020 NOTE This is only an announcement; PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE. Subsequent calls will be issued under this announcement to solicit proposals for specific efforts. Please refer to the attachment section of this announcement for the calls.? Publication of this announcement does not obligate the DoD to review any white papers submission beyond an initial administrative review, or to award any specific project, or to obligate any available funds. Executive Summary In order to effectively engage peer and near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Air Force needs to develop, acquire and operate systems as a unified force across all domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum).? The Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (DAFRCO) in partnership with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Architecture and Integration Directorate (AFLCMC/XA) seeks to develop a cross-cutter portfolio of complimentary/ linked projects and programs to support Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). The Air Force intends to facilitate the rapid exploration and maturation of innovative?technologies. The Air Force will support future operations by providing the critical surveillance, tactical edge communications, processing, networking, and battle management command and control capabilities to the joint warfighting force.? ABMS is not envisioned as a single program of record, but rather an open architecture family of systems that enables capabilities via multiple integrated platforms.? ABMS will realize the vision of JADC2 to enhance and expand capabilities by enabling any sensor to inform any shooter in any domain?land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. ?In an interview with Air Force Magazine in April 2019, General Goldfein stated, ?It is a significant move for the Air Force to shift from a platform solution on command and control and battle management to a network solution going forward, and our future in the business of joint warfighting is to ensure that we?re taking every sensor and every shooter and connecting them together to overwhelm an adversary?.? Our aim is to have intelligence and targeting data transformed into timely and actionable information through trusted networks and intelligent algorithms that enable our people to focus on decisions.? In this construct, information is a service, rather than a platform, and the layers of sensing and the communication pathways will provide reliability and assurance in contested environments.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) / (AFRC) is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for Flight opportunities Program Flight and Payload Integration Services IV. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. Information received in response to this sources sought notice will be used for market research only and shall not be viewed as NASA?s intent to solicit proposals. If NASA decides a requirement exists and there is a need to solicit for this requirement, NASA will solicit the requirement using a method of solicitation defined within the FAR and NASA FAR Supplement, using NAICS Code and Size Standard 481219 and $16.5M revenue, respectively. DESCRIPTION OF PERFORMANCE: Potential sources must be primarily a United States domestic entity. Potential sources must demonstrate their capability of providing Flight and Payload Integration Services and in some instances, human accommodations. Typical platforms will include (but are not limited to) high-altitude balloons, suborbital rockets, sounding rockets, rocket powered landing vehicles and vertical flight testbeds, which must be capable of meeting one or more of the required flight profiles. Vehicles for flight services shall be currently operational, in a flight test status as a minimum, and conclusively demonstrated to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements as defined in the flight profiles. Legacy vehicles not currently in operational status will not be considered as qualifying for the purposes of meeting the flight profile requirements. Vehicles must be capable of accommodating a minimum payload mass of 5Kg and minimum payload volume equivalent to a 5U cubesat (5L or 5,000cc). The required flight profiles shall consist of the following, defined from the payload perspective: Profile 1 (P1): Reduced gravity with space environment Payload is typically an experiment requiring two (2) or more minutes of continuous microgravity and/or exposure to the space environment. Requirement is to ascend to a minimum of 80km above mean sea level (MSL), desired ? 100km MSL, and expose the payload to a total gravitational vector of less than +/- 0.005g (RMS) under stable gravitational conditions in all axes for at least two (2) minutes. Some payloads may also require the simultaneous exposure of the payload to near-vacuum and low temperature. This is typically accomplished by use of a sounding rocket or spacecraft. Vehicles that can achieve the required altitude and reduced gravity but cannot expose the payload to the outside environment may also be qualified for this profile. Profile 2 (P2): Exposure to high altitude and long-duration flight Under this profile, platforms shall offer the payload with external views, including a view of the earth below as well as access to the environment for sensing. Payload types will vary, including remote sensing packages or other systems being qualified for use on satellites or other spacecraft. These can be tested by use of an untethered balloon with parachute descent that could allow, for example, for testing experimental parachutes or similar atmospheric descent systems. Other platforms could include untethered balloons or untethered airships with guided trajectory capabilities and controlled landings. The aforementioned platforms may have additional capabilities such as altitude loitering or geolocation station keeping. In all cases, landing characteristics should be sufficient to recover the payload by means of a soft landing or a parachute recovery, for example. For consideration under this profile, a QV shall meet the requirements listed below: ? ? ? ? ? Exposure to high altitude:? ? ? ? ? ? Payload is typically an experiment requiring exposure to the near-space environment at a minimum of 30km MSL with a flight time of 1 hour or greater along a pre-planned guided flight trajectory, followed by a descent to 0 AGL. ? ? ? ? ? Exposure to altitude and long-duration flight: ? ? ? ? ? Payload is typically an experiment requiring exposure to an altitude of at least 18 km MSL and have a float time of 7 days or greater along a pre-planned flight trajectory, followed by a descent to 0 AGL. Profile 3 (P3): Space environment with free-fall descent Payload typically involves testing of systems and components such as thermal protection or decelerators for objects reentering a planetary atmosphere. Requirement is to attain a minimum of 80km MSL, typically ? 100km MSL, followed by a rapid free-fall descent of the payload to 0 km AGL. This is typically accomplished by use of a sounding rocket or spacecraft with the payload ejected at apogee. Profile 4 (P4): Controlled descent with controlled vertical landing Payload is typically an experiment to test concepts for planetary landers. Requirement is to descend from a minimum of 250m above ground level (AGL) to 0m AGL, under controlled rocket-powered flight and conduct a controlled vertical landing. Some payloads may require controlled horizontal translation of up to 1 km. Some applications may require allowing the payload to actively control portions of the flight profile. This is typically accomplished by use of a spacecraft or a vertical flight testbed. Profile 5 (P5): Controlled high altitude ascent and descent Requirement is to ascend to a minimum of 30km MSL along a pre-planned trajectory, spend 1 or more minutes above 30km MSL, and then descend back to 0 AGL along a controlled trajectory. Payload is typically a remote sensing system for planetary entry, high-altitude atmospheric measurements, or similar applications. Payloads may require access to the external environment to make observations or obtain measurements. It would be desirable to have the capability of accepting control inputs from the payload. It would also be desirable to provide the payload a view of the earth below. Landing should be sufficient to recover the payload intact, which may entail either a soft landing or a parachute recovery. In some cases, platforms may have different ascent and descent locations as part of a single flight. This is typically accomplished by use of a spacecraft or first (primary) stage of a multi-stage rocket-powered vehicle. Some payloads may be required to achieve short durations of reduced gravity under this flight profile.

All firms should be certified in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at https://www.sam.gov/ PROJECT NUMBER:???CA ERFO 2020-1(1)? PROJECT NAME:? ?Smittle Creek Trail Bridges? PROJECT DESCRIPTION:? The CA ERFO 2020-1(1) Smittle Creek Trail Bridges project is located in Napa County, CA, along the shores of Lake Berryessa. The Bureau of Reclamation manages a number of recreation sites around Lake Berryessa. The project site is approximately 40 miles west of Sacramento, CA in rolling terrain. The Smittle Creek Trail is 2.6 miles long and meanders along the shoreline of Lake Berryessa through woodlands. The intent of the project is to replace six (6) pedestrian trail bridges which were damaged in the Hennessey Fire in 2020. SCOPE OF THE WORK:? The purpose of the project is to restore access along the Smittle Creek and Markley Trail systems, by constructing six (6) pedestrian trail bridges. Five (5) of the trail bridges are located within a 1.0-mile-long section of the Smittle Creek Trail on the western shore of Lake Berryessa. One (1) bridge is located on the Markley Trail, near Markley Cove, which is just upstream of the Monticello Dam. A Design-Build contract is planned as the contracting mechanism for this project. Prefabricated steel structures are contemplated as the replacement bridge system. Bridge spans range from 20 to 30 feet at all sites. Major work elements include the following: final design and shop drawing submittal of steel bridges, design of bridge foundation system, bridge and foundation construction, and light trail work (grading) at bridge approaches. The trail systems are currently closed to the public. The existing trails have a 4- to 6-foot-wide bench and are native surfaced. The trails are currently overgrown with grasses due to a lack of usage. Accessing the sites will be a significant consideration during construction. Accessing the sites can be accomplished using the existing trail with small equipment. Alternatively, access with small to medium equipment may be accomplished using overland routes to the bridge sites, provided the surrounding environment is not significantly impacted. No tree removal or significant ground disturbance (excavation) will be allowed during site access operations. ?PRINCIPAL WORK ITEMS: Description? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Unit? ? ? ? ? ?

The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The size standard for this NAICS is 1000 employees. Background: The NCCOS Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring & Reference Branch and the Ecotoxicology branch currently utilize four (4) SCIEX triple quadrupole mass spectrometers coupled to liquid chromatography systems for its analysis needs. Three (3) of these instruments two (2) API 4000 & one (1) 4000Qtrap are more than 15 years old, and are nearing the end of their service/support lifecycle, which results in a risk of being unable to meet the mission. Procuring the next generation of mass spectrometers will maintain our ability to generate high quality data to meet project deadlines while remaining operational and serviceable. The Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring & Reference branch utilizes trap-based triple quadrupole mass spectrometers coupled to liquid chromatography systems to detect and quantify trace levels of algal toxins and their metabolites from a variety of environmental matrices while the Chemical Contaminants Research (CCR) group with the Ecotoxicology branch requires a trap-based triple quad mass spectrometer (MS/MS) to detect and quantify low to trace levels of environmental chemicals associated with physiological/hormone measurement, plastic marine debris, proteins, per and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances, pharmaceuticals and personal care products and persistent organic contaminants. These instruments must be able to reproducibly generate high resolution and high-quality MS and MS/MS data that include molecule fragmentation with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in order to accurately identify and quantify unknown analytes in complex matrices.

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.? The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:? (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.? Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.? An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.?? Background: The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) supports a comprehensive research portfolio to advance biological knowledge of HIV/AIDS, its related co-infections, and co-morbidities. With the ultimate goal of creating an ?AIDS-free Generation,? the Division develops and supports the research infrastructure and biomedical research needed to: 1) halt the spread of HIV through the development of an effective vaccine and biomedical prevention strategies that are safe and desirable; 2) develop novel approaches for the treatment and cure of HIV infection; 3) treat and/or prevent HIV co-infections and co-morbidities of greatest significance; and 4) partner with scientific and community stakeholders to efficiently implement effective interventions. Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), continues to be a significant public health burden and global threat. In 2019 alone, there were over 10 million new cases of TB infection world-wide, with 1.2 million new cases in People with HIV (PWH). TB is the leading cause of death among PWH. PWH are 15-22 times more likely to develop active TB, with fatality rates 16-25% greater than those without HIV, and are the most vulnerable to drug-resistant TB. In recent years, significant research efforts have focused on evaluating novel approaches for TB prevention, diagnosis and treatment in pregnant and postpartum women, infants, children, and adolescents, with and without HIV. These efforts have led to the development of shorter, safer treatment regimens for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB disease; identification of optimal TB preventive therapy for drug-susceptible latent TB infection and household contacts exposed to multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB); and optimization of treatments for TB meningitis. However, despite these efforts, approximately 30% of all new cases of TB go undiagnosed each year. Ending the TB epidemic relies in great part on the early, accurate, and rapid diagnosis of MTB infection to facilitate screening and triage, improve case detection, and initiate effective treatment regimens.? The primary purpose of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Quality Assessment (TBQA) contract is to support and promote access to quality-assured MTB laboratory diagnosis and testing across laboratories participating in DAIDS-supported clinical trials. MTB laboratories play a critical role in generating data that determine primary and secondary endpoints for TB clinical trials. The harmonization of methodologies among the various testing laboratories (Labs) ensures comparability of test results across multiple trial-supporting labs and comparability of data between trials. The use of appropriate methodologies and reliable test results ensures the safety of study participants and supports product advancement and approval by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory entities. The TBQA will continue to serve current and future NIAID-sponsored clinical trial networks, cohorts, and collaborating study groups (User Groups), as well as individual grantees conducting clinical research. The current contract is held by MRIGlobal, Kansas City, MO, under contract number HHSN272201700001C. The period of performance of the current contract is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2023. Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of the proposed contract will be to provide a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) Quality Assessment Program (TBQA), a resource to: (1) support the ability of laboratories (Labs) to reliably perform study-specified MTB tests; (2) evaluate MTB technologies and specimen processes for use in clinical investigations; and (3) disseminate technical and scientific data. This contract also includes Options to increase level of effort in support of: (1) unanticipated increases in demand related to support of additional Labs; (2) performance of late-stage assay validation and/or MTB assay testing of clinical samples in a CLIA-certified laboratory; and (3) public health emergency needs. The TBQA will serve NIAID-sponsored and collaborating clinical trial networks and cohorts as well as individual grantees conducting research in and outside the U.S. Examples of NIAID-sponsored Networks include the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), the International Maternal Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). Examples of NIAID-sponsored TB cohorts include the India and Brazil Regional Prospective Observational Research for Tuberculosis (RePORT). Anticipated Period of Performance: It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement, term/level of effort, type contact will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options to extend the term of the contract that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible period of performance of seven (7) years, beginning approximately October 16, 2023 The requirement will be the delivery of 5.0 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and 5.0 FTEs per year for Options 1-6 (Years 2-7).? In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. Options for increased services may include: Options 1 through 6, to Extend the Term of the Contract:? The Government may exercise options to extend the period of the contract beyond the Base Period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years. The scope and types of activities as outlined for Year 1 of the contract would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period, up to 7 total years. The percentage of effort includes the effort of subcontracts and consultants. Options 7 through 27, to Increase Level of Effort for Additional Labs: The Government may exercise Options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the activities supported by the base requirements of this contract. During the course of the contract, it may be necessary to incorporate additional Labs to support NIAID-supported clinical trials. Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's effort activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an Option. Each Option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of 5 Labs. If the Government elects to exercise this Option, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.0 FTE. One Option for adding new Labs may be exercised once per year during any year of the contract, beginning with Year 2 of the contract, to a total of 21 options during the life of the contract, as follows:?

Statement of Work Overhaul Nineteen Vertical Turbine Pumps at the Dissolved Oxygen Injection System Sites Removal, transportation, disassembly, inspection, possibly repair, reassembly, transportation and installation of nineteen (19) Vertical Turbine Pumps (VTPs) at the Down River (DR) and/or Up River (UR) Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Injection System sites.? It is envisioned that four to five VTPs would overhauled yearly during the offseason (November to April) with potential emergency rebuilds being required during the run season (May to October).? As stated, there are a total of 19 VTPs split between two locations (10 at Hutchinson Island, Savannah and 9 at Rincon, GA) in the Savannah, GA area. There is a possibility that VTPs would be pulled from each location during a rebuild season.? Listed below is the type, number of each type, and salient information for each type of VTP.? All VTPs were manufactured by ITT Gould. For reference: the naming convention for VTPs at the Down River DO sIte is DP-1 through DP-10, VTPs at the Up River DO sIte is UP-1 through UP-9. Removal and installation of the VTPs has taken two cranes working in tandem.? The VTPs would be lifted out of their holes and over existing infrastructure in order to be loaded onto flatbeds. VTP motors would be separated from the pump bodies and stored at the respective DO sites. The incumbent contractor will be responsible to store the VTP motors in a manner protected from the elements.

NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING REQUESTED UNDER THIS NOTICE. This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes to identify interested firms for the potential requirement detailed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541360 (Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services) and the size standard is $16.5 Million. The Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition. Background: The United States Geological Survey (USGS), The Geosciences and Environmental Change (GEC) Science Center conducts geologic investigations into the geologic framework of the United States. GEC projects carried out as part of the USGS National Cooperative Geologic Program (NCGMP) require subsurface information that is supplied mainly through borehole data and multichannel reflection seismic data. These data sources are used to determine geologic structure, stratigraphic relationships, and geologic history as they relate to the construction of regional 3D earth models. To this end, the USGS currently requires seismic data brokers to furnish and deliver two dimensional (2-D) multichannel seismic reflection data from an area of interest (AOI) in the United States mid-continent. Area of Interest (AOI): The USGS area of interest includes the following counties in west-central Oklahoma: Ellis, Woodward, Major, Roger Mills, Dewey, Custer, Blaine, Beckham, Washita, and Caddo, and the eastern parts of three counties in the eastern part of the Texas panhandle: Lipscomb, Hemphill, and Wheeler (magenta box, fig. 1 as Attachment 1). The USGS currently holds seismic rights to five northeast-oriented lines within the area of interest (thick grey lines, fig 1). The USGS seeks to acquire rights to additional seismic data along lines that are oriented roughly east-west, or southeast-northwest, to be generally perpendicular to the existing lines. New lines of interest to the USGS would extend from the vicinity of USGS lines in Blaine, Custer, and Washita (OK) counties in the east to the USGS lines in Woodward, Ellis, Roger Mills, and Beckham (OK) and Wheeler County (TX) on the west. The new roughly east-west oriented lines would ideally connect with the existing USGS lines at both ends and serve as a ""geophysical tie"" between the existing USGS lines. If available lines are not long enough to fully connect between the existing USGS lines, the USGS would have interest in roughly east-west oriented lines that cross one of the existing USGS and extend some distance into the region of Dewey, Custer, and Washita (OK) Counties between the two NE-oriented swaths of USGS lines. Please see Attachment 1 - Figure 1. Location map of Oklahoma and northern part of Texas showing Area of Interest and existing seismic data. The 2-D seismic reflection data from the AOI must have been acquired from and processed using the following minimum standards: Description of Data: The contractor shall provide the USGS access to its data library of 2-D multichannel seismic reflection data recorded within the following AOI 38.50 degrees W to 33.50 degrees W and -102.50 degrees W to -96.00 degrees W. Minimum Acquisition Parameters: a. Energy Source: Dynamite, Vibroseis and/or Primacord b. Record Length: 2 seconds or more. c. Sample Rate: .5 milliseconds or more, but not more than 4 milliseconds d. Number of Recording Channels: 24 or more e. Stack Fold: 6 or more f. Must have been recorded digitally (not with an analog recording system) Minimum Processing Parameters: The data must have been processed within 18 months of original acquisition using industry standard techniques at the time of processing. Processing after the demultiplexing of field data will include at a minimum, gain correction(s), pre-stack deconvolution, at least one pass of velocity analysis, residual statics corrections, normal moveout correction, and CMP stacking. If the data has been re-processed at a later date the USGS requests the data using the most recent version of the processing available to the vendor. A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. All business concerns who believe they can responsibly provide this type of Seismic Data product should submit the following information to the Contracting Officer: 1. The firm shall specify the Seismic Data product that meets the specifications listed above. 2. The firm shall specify that they are either a small business (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.) Or other than small business under the NAICS Code listed in the announcement. 3. The firm shall provide a point of contact name and e-mail information, and the firm?s Cage Code, and SAM.gov UEI. NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for quotations. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement. In order to be responsive to this Notice, a firm must provide the appropriate documentation for consideration by June 15, 2022. Responses that do not comply with these procedures will not be considered. Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail to Lisa Williams at ldwilliams@usgs.gov"

These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.? In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and security requirements and the facility will include design in metric units.? PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project is a new land port of entry on the northern border in Minnesota. The proposed site is in International Falls, adjacent to an existing Land Port of Entry. This new project will be a gateway to our country and will transform an obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art commercial port of entry, which will improve safety and security for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It shall make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. The intended delivery method will be Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) which will include a firm-fixed price Design Phase and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Construction Phase Option. The Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the current tenant. The existing facility was constructed in 1993, and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.? Although the existing Land Port of Entry is not old, it was designed and constructed several years before the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the significant changes to the way business operations occur at the border. It is on an extremely constrained and congested site which is surrounded by an active paper mill operation, traversed by inbound and outbound road and rail traffic, and is? very close to the foot of the international bridge connecting International Falls and Fort Frances, Ontario. Consequently, the current facility is not adequate in size, efficiency, safety and security. The existing building cannot be expanded upon to meet the new requirements of the Federal Inspection Services on the existing site. SCOPE OF WORK The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, interior space planning, and related consulting services for the concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, development of a GSA Building Design Standard, Building Information Modeling (BIM), computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) administration, Information Technology (IT), Audio Visual (AV), security, and post-construction contract services (PCCS). The project is also to include GSA design standards; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements, including the Land Port of Entry Design Standard. GSA aims to minimize tenant disruption and maintain operation of the existing LPOE throughout construction through construction phasing. The project scope includes an expanded Program of Requirements, over a previous FY2011 study, of space and facilities for the Federal Inspection Services/Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Agriculture Plant Protection and Quarantine (USDA), and Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), to carry out their agency missions at the border. The current facility only houses CBP; USDA and FWS will be new tenants in the new LPOE. The improvements project includes design and construction of new buildings. Expanding the site will allow for enhanced traffic flow and management, and removing existing dangerous traffic conflicts between travelers entering and leaving the United States with railroad trains traversing the current site. POTENTIAL RISKS The project will be compliant with the Design Excellence Guiding Principles and GSA's Design Excellence Program will be implemented as part of the project. The project must occur while the existing port remains fully operational. In accordance with NHPA Section 106, consultation with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) must be conducted and an archeological survey must be completed. Unknown site and environmental issues will be investigated during the course of design and remediation plans developed, as appropriate.? Stormwater management on the constrained site will require use of Best Management Practices to comply with EISA Section 438. Sustainability requirements and goals beyond P-100 baselines, including LEED Gold and Site Silver, reduction in whole-building embodied carbon, operational Net Zero, Fossil Fuel Free, Water Net Zero, and Grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) resilience will require study and integration into the project to the maximum extent possible.

This capability includes a new software defined receiver with a Program of Record (PoR) designation as ?Software Defined User Equipment (SDUE)? and a new digital resilient antenna electronics (RAE) package with a PoR designation of ?Soteria?.? ? An RFI for SDUE was previously posted on 02 Jul 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/47e113d4819c478c95984964d068b6fa/view. An RFI for Aircraft Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) (now Soteria) was previously posted on 17 Dec 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/fbbd846e765840ee85dd66bfd0558899/view. These RFIs were originally focused on developing the SDUE and Soteria as two separate acquisition programs. The Government now believes developing the SDUE and Soteria together as a single acquisition program will provide a lower risk approach and ensure effective interface compatibility between SDUE and Soteria. If you previously responded to these RFIs and your prior responses are still valid, then please state that your previous responses are still accurate and complete.? If you wish to provide any new or updated information to your previous RFI responses (or if you did not respond before), please provide your comments to any of the questions in the original RFI?s, as found at the links shown above.? ?? The Government is evaluating options for a planned Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) effort that may use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and the selection of a Design Agent (DA) to lead a rapid prototyping and rapid production requirements effort. The Government would like to understand prime contractor interest in accomplishing the total effort in-house or using subcontractor arrangements as necessary.? Additionally, the Government would like to understand SDUE contractor interest in accomplishing the SDUE development/rapid prototyping effort.? Similarly, the Government would like to understand Soteria contractor interest in accomplishing the Soteria development/rapid prototyping effort. Purpose/Description? Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) for a wide range of military operations. Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) data in support of this, but must be designed to ensure performance in operational environments. Currently fielded GPS receivers contribute to this necessary capability but are susceptible to degradation in electronic threat (e.g., jamming, spoofing) environments.? Advanced Anti-Jam (AJ) antenna and/or antenna electronics systems may be leveraged to reduce electronic interference in GPS radio frequency (RF) bandwidths, particularly when employing null-steering and beamforming technologies.? In many cases, the hardware and software interface between the GPS receiver and the antenna electronics is proprietary and dependent upon the vendor(s) represented.? This dependency restricts an aircraft platform?s ability to incorporate changes or upgrades to the PNT system without incurring appreciable cost and integration complexity increases associated with replacing either the AJ system, the PNT receiver, or integrated navigation Line Replaceable Units (LRU).? A more open system is intended to help counter this by providing an efficient means to modify the PNT system in response to evolving threats and updated requirements. Beyond the ?vendor lock? issue, the challenge of evolving threats and the resulting need to modify the current hardware and software may take nearly a decade to develop, test, produce, integrate, and field the next solution.? This duration is unacceptable when today?s threats are evolving at an accelerated pace.? To this end, the PNT PO is pursuing the development of a Multi-Global Navigation Satellite System (MGNSS)-capable Software Defined Receiver (SDR), known as SDUE, as well as compatible MGNSS antenna electronics, named Soteria. SDUE shall support adaptable, reprogrammable navigation solutions through the use of GPS military signals, Regional Military Protect (RMP) signals, non-GPS Satellite Navigation (SATNAV) signals, and others that may be available in the future. Soteria shall support AJ, which can take advantage of MGNSS signals, Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) signals, and flexible waveforms. The required Soteria capabilities are AJ, Anti-Spoof (AS), and Situational Awareness (SA) across the entire MGNSS/SATNAV spectrum, which encompasses all L-band frequencies. The data and control interface between Soteria and SDUE shall allow for the transmission/receipt of aiding and control data, signal and state selection messages, and beamformed data that will be required to support these capabilities. SDUE will receive from Soteria the processed I/Q beamformed measurements and nulling-only protected RF signals for all visible MGNSS satellites. Defining a physical and informational open standard for the Soteria interface is vital to employ advanced AJ/AS/SA capabilities in concert with the SDUE. It will promote competition based on performance and cost. In summary, the Government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical and physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols throughout the navigation architecture, addressing antenna subsystems and avionics architectures. Security Certified Software Defined Receiver and Standard Digital Interface The SDUE shall be a security certified, unclassified-when-keyed software defined SATNAV military receiver based on a field-programmable logic device technology (e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Array {FPGA}, Programmable Logic Device {PLD}, System on a Chip {SoC} FPGA). The design should be manufacturer-agnostic, shall implement the GPS security requirements set forth in GPU-PRD-711 and GPU-PRD-705, and comply with cyber requirements. The Government is projecting it can furnish an FPGA-based, security-certified architecture and associated intellectual property with Full/Government purpose data rights (as appropriate, and jointly agreed to) for the SDUE effort.? The security-certified architecture and intellectual property is currently being developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory under a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract with The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) on a project known as ?Janus?.? This architecture is expected to be security-certified by Dec 2025, in accordance with GPU-PRD-705. ?NOTE: An interim process/certification report will be available by late Summer 2023. Respondents are under no obligation to use what may be provided from the Janus effort to develop and deliver the required capabilities.? Respondents can use other secure, feasible, and efficient alternatives of the FPGA or devise their own architecture, as long as the Government can obtain data rights for the implemented architecture. As part of an Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD) effort, MITRE and The Ohio State University Antenna Electronics (OSU) teams are collaborating on the development of a standard interface and an interface control document (ICD). This will allow interoperability between MGNSS receivers and MGNSS beamsteering antennas, in order to break vendor lock scenarios and enable the effective and efficient insertion of new and advanced capabilities. The Government plans to engage industry to discuss the draft standard interface design with vendors, and to consider vendor inputs and recommendations, with the goal of defining a universally acceptable open interface standard. Operational Context Soteria, SDUE, and the Resilient-Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (R-EGI) are the three components that will collectively provide the Vanguard (first use) targeted capabilities necessary to deliver robust and resilient PNT to the warfighter. These three systems are envisioned to be nominally configured as shown in the attached document. The integrated capabilities of the proposed systems are shown as intended to support the effective and affordable operation of USAF, Joint/Coalition platforms, and weapon systems in evolving threat environments. It should be noted the three systems are expected to operate in a tightly coupled relationship, allowing aiding and the sharing of information to provide the desired resiliency and robustness while executing AS and SA functions. Hence, the Government is placing an emphasis on using non-proprietary open standard interfaces.

If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company or institution?s capabilities in meeting these requirements.? Failure to provide this documentation may prevent the Government from being able to assess your capabilities.? If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience or capabilities in order to perform that aspect of the requirement (i.e., through teaming or subcontracting). Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business applicants. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research.? Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged but not required. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) offerings, whether used as a contracting vehicle by a sole RFI responder or to RFI responders as part of a consortium, will be considered by the Government to achieve requirements.? RFI responders are requested to indicate any prior experience working under an OTA construct. RFI responders are requested to identify as a University Affiliated Research Center, if applicable. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, as identified on the final page of this RFI. As stated in the ?Department of Defense Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers?, version 1.1 (Jun 2013), the five principles of OSA are: Modular designs based on standards, with loose coupling and high cohesion, that allow for independent acquisition of system components. Enterprise investment strategies, based on collaboration and trust, that maximize reuse of proven hardware system designs and ensure we spend the least to get the best. Transformation of the life cycle sustainment strategies for software intensive systems through proven technology insertion and software product upgrade techniques. Dramatically lower development risk through transparency of system designs, continuous design disclosure, and Government, academia, and industry peer reviews. Strategic use of data rights to ensure a level competitive playing field and access to alternative solutions and sources, across the life cycle. As alluded to in principle 1. above, the establishment of an open Soteria standard (software and hardware) will allow one or more qualified third parties to add, modify, replace, remove, or provide support for the antenna electronics or the LRU independently. ?Moreover, while an architecture incorporating any physical layer configuration will be considered, preferred proposed solutions will minimize Group A changes, to maintain the form and fit of current antennas and antenna electronics components and connecting cables.? To this end, it will be valuable for RFI responders to present existing interface control documents, and/or to demonstrate a capability to generate a best of breed SDUE and Soteria interface solution from existing solutions or concepts. Interested parties shall provide information that demonstrates the following: Section A: New requests to address (beyond the original RFI questions) The first spiral of Soteria and SDUE, to be called the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), shall be based on the existing L1/L2 platform Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) capabilities (e.g., N79), and the use of L1/L2 GPS, L1/L2 QZSS, and Galileo E1 signals. Describe your approach and processes to satisfy the MVP requirements. Describe your approach and processes to upgrade the software and hardware (as needed) beyond the MVP requirements to allow capabilities that exploit the other MGNSS and Iridium signals existing in the band from 1160 MHz to 1627 MHz. NOTE: The Soteria SWAP is not to exceed the current ADAP SWAP.??The SDUE SWAP is not to exceed the current MGUE Inc.-I Aviation card SWAP. Given the existing SWAP and datalink limitations, describe the number of MGNSS signals to which your beamform can approach, and explain your plan to manage AJ for the remaining MGNSS signals. Describe your processes to maintain compatibility and synergy between Soteria and SDUE as new capabilities and updates are implemented in a manner to stay relevant in the evolving threat environment. It is expected that the insertion of Soteria, SDUE, and R-EGI into platforms will be staggered, for various technical and programmatic reasons. Describe your approach to enable modularity and interoperability among various combinations of CRPAs (existing and planned; for example, GSTAR, DIGAR, Soteria), GPS and MGNSS receiver modules (e.g., MGUE, SDUE), and/or PNT Line Replaceable Units (e.g., EGI-M, R-EGI).? All solutions should adhere to the principles of open systems architecture mentioned previously. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your preferred solution (which may use a teaming or prime/subcontractor plan)? Briefly describe your preferred approach and the elements involved (e.g., use of a Design Agent, prime contractor, or subcontractor) to execute the SDUE and Soteria acquisition program. NOTE: This question is optional. The Government is interested in the overall rapid prototyping cost. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for your proposed Development effort. Respondents are requested to provide a ROM estimate for the SDUE and Soteria rapid prototype phases, which can be provided as a range. These ROM estimates are not intended as a solicitation proposal cost, but merely to support planning for the Government?s Program Objective Memorandum (POM) funding.?

NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING REQUESTED UNDER THIS NOTICE. This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes to identify interested firms for the potential requirement detailed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541360 (Geophysical Surveying and Mapping Services) and the size standard is $16.5 Million. The Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition. Background: The United States Geological Survey (USGS), The Geosciences and Environmental Change (GEC) Science Center conducts geologic investigations into the geologic framework of the United States. GEC projects carried out as part of the USGS National Cooperative Geologic Program (NCGMP) require subsurface information that is supplied mainly through borehole data and multichannel reflection seismic data. These data sources are used to determine geologic structure, stratigraphic relationships, and geologic history as they relate to the construction of regional 3D earth models. To this end, the USGS currently requires seismic data brokers to furnish and deliver two dimensional (2-D) multichannel seismic reflection data from an area of interest (AOI) in the United States mid-continent. Area of Interest (AOI): The USGS area of interest includes the following counties in west-central Oklahoma: Ellis, Woodward, Major, Roger Mills, Dewey, Custer, Blaine, Beckham, Washita, and Caddo, and the eastern parts of three counties in the eastern part of the Texas panhandle: Lipscomb, Hemphill, and Wheeler (magenta box, fig. 1 as Attachment 1). The USGS currently holds seismic rights to five northeast-oriented lines within the area of interest (thick grey lines, fig 1). The USGS seeks to acquire rights to additional seismic data along lines that are oriented roughly east-west, or southeast-northwest, to be generally perpendicular to the existing lines. New lines of interest to the USGS would extend from the vicinity of USGS lines in Blaine, Custer, and Washita (OK) counties in the east to the USGS lines in Woodward, Ellis, Roger Mills, and Beckham (OK) and Wheeler County (TX) on the west. The new roughly east-west oriented lines would ideally connect with the existing USGS lines at both ends and serve as a ""geophysical tie"" between the existing USGS lines. If available lines are not long enough to fully connect between the existing USGS lines, the USGS would have interest in roughly east-west oriented lines that cross one of the existing USGS and extend some distance into the region of Dewey, Custer, and Washita (OK) Counties between the two NE-oriented swaths of USGS lines. Please see Attachment 1 - Figure 1. Location map of Oklahoma and northern part of Texas showing Area of Interest and existing seismic data. The 2-D seismic reflection data from the AOI must have been acquired from and processed using the following minimum standards: Description of Data: The contractor shall provide the USGS access to its data library of 2-D multichannel seismic reflection data recorded within the following AOI 38.50 degrees W to 33.50 degrees W and -102.50 degrees W to -96.00 degrees W. Minimum Acquisition Parameters: a. Energy Source: Dynamite, Vibroseis and/or Primacord b. Record Length: 2 seconds or more. c. Sample Rate: .5 milliseconds or more, but not more than 4 milliseconds d. Number of Recording Channels: 24 or more e. Stack Fold: 6 or more f. Must have been recorded digitally (not with an analog recording system) Minimum Processing Parameters: The data must have been processed within 18 months of original acquisition using industry standard techniques at the time of processing. Processing after the demultiplexing of field data will include at a minimum, gain correction(s), pre-stack deconvolution, at least one pass of velocity analysis, residual statics corrections, normal moveout correction, and CMP stacking. If the data has been re-processed at a later date the USGS requests the data using the most recent version of the processing available to the vendor. A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. All business concerns who believe they can responsibly provide this type of Seismic Data product should submit the following information to the Contracting Officer: 1. The firm shall specify the Seismic Data product that meets the specifications listed above. 2. The firm shall specify that they are either a small business (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.) Or other than small business under the NAICS Code listed in the announcement. 3. The firm shall provide a point of contact name and e-mail information, and the firm?s Cage Code, and SAM.gov UEI. NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for quotations. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement. In order to be responsive to this Notice, a firm must provide the appropriate documentation for consideration by June 15, 2022. Responses that do not comply with these procedures will not be considered. Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail to Lisa Williams at ldwilliams@usgs.gov"

Number: 47PF0022F0039 Region: 05 City: International Falls State: Minnesota Contracting Officer: Anna Vanko Phone Number: 513-505-6253 PROJECT: International Falls Land Port of Entry, International Falls, MN? PROJECT TYPE: New Construction - Land Port of Entry CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Projection SIZE: approximately 100,000 gsf to 150,000 gsf BUDGET: $154,000,000 to $164,000,000? FUNDING: Funds are currently available via Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented designers and artists to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.? In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and security requirements and the facility will include design in metric units.? PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project is a new land port of entry on the northern border in Minnesota. The proposed site is in International Falls, adjacent to an existing Land Port of Entry. This new project will be a gateway to our country and will transform an obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art commercial port of entry, which will improve safety and security for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It shall make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. The intended delivery method will be Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) which will include a firm-fixed price Design Phase and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Construction Phase Option. The Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the current tenant. The existing facility was constructed in 1993, and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.? Although the existing Land Port of Entry is not old, it was designed and constructed several years before the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the significant changes to the way business operations occur at the border. It is on an extremely constrained and congested site which is surrounded by an active paper mill operation, traversed by inbound and outbound road and rail traffic, and is? very close to the foot of the international bridge connecting International Falls and Fort Frances, Ontario. Consequently, the current facility is not adequate in size, efficiency, safety and security. The existing building cannot be expanded upon to meet the new requirements of the Federal Inspection Services on the existing site. SCOPE OF WORK The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, interior space planning, and related consulting services for the concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, development of a GSA Building Design Standard, Building Information Modeling (BIM), computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) administration, Information Technology (IT), Audio Visual (AV), security, and post-construction contract services (PCCS). The project is also to include GSA design standards; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements, including the Land Port of Entry Design Standard. GSA aims to minimize tenant disruption and maintain operation of the existing LPOE throughout construction through construction phasing. The project scope includes an expanded Program of Requirements, over a previous FY2011 study, of space and facilities for the Federal Inspection Services/Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Agriculture Plant Protection and Quarantine (USDA), and Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), to carry out their agency missions at the border. The current facility only houses CBP; USDA and FWS will be new tenants in the new LPOE. The improvements project includes design and construction of new buildings. Expanding the site will allow for enhanced traffic flow and management, and removing existing dangerous traffic conflicts between travelers entering and leaving the United States with railroad trains traversing the current site. POTENTIAL RISKS The project will be compliant with the Design Excellence Guiding Principles and GSA's Design Excellence Program will be implemented as part of the project. The project must occur while the existing port remains fully operational. In accordance with NHPA Section 106, consultation with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) must be conducted and an archeological survey must be completed. Unknown site and environmental issues will be investigated during the course of design and remediation plans developed, as appropriate.? Stormwater management on the constrained site will require use of Best Management Practices to comply with EISA Section 438. Sustainability requirements and goals beyond P-100 baselines, including LEED Gold and Site Silver, reduction in whole-building embodied carbon, operational Net Zero, Fossil Fuel Free, Water Net Zero, and Grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) resilience will require study and integration into the project to the maximum extent possible.

This capability includes a new software defined receiver with a Program of Record (PoR) designation as ?Software Defined User Equipment (SDUE)? and a new digital resilient antenna electronics (RAE) package with a PoR designation of ?Soteria?.? ? An RFI for SDUE was previously posted on 02 Jul 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/47e113d4819c478c95984964d068b6fa/view. An RFI for Aircraft Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) (now Soteria) was previously posted on 17 Dec 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/fbbd846e765840ee85dd66bfd0558899/view. These RFIs were originally focused on developing the SDUE and Soteria as two separate acquisition programs. The Government now believes developing the SDUE and Soteria together as a single acquisition program will provide a lower risk approach and ensure effective interface compatibility between SDUE and Soteria. If you previously responded to these RFIs and your prior responses are still valid, then please state that your previous responses are still accurate and complete.? If you wish to provide any new or updated information to your previous RFI responses (or if you did not respond before), please provide your comments to any of the questions in the original RFI?s, as found at the links shown above.? ?? The Government is evaluating options for a planned Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) effort that may use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and the selection of a Design Agent (DA) to lead a rapid prototyping and rapid production requirements effort. The Government would like to understand prime contractor interest in accomplishing the total effort in-house or using subcontractor arrangements as necessary.? Additionally, the Government would like to understand SDUE contractor interest in accomplishing the SDUE development/rapid prototyping effort.? Similarly, the Government would like to understand Soteria contractor interest in accomplishing the Soteria development/rapid prototyping effort. Purpose/Description? Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) for a wide range of military operations. Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) data in support of this, but must be designed to ensure performance in operational environments. Currently fielded GPS receivers contribute to this necessary capability but are susceptible to degradation in electronic threat (e.g., jamming, spoofing) environments.? Advanced Anti-Jam (AJ) antenna and/or antenna electronics systems may be leveraged to reduce electronic interference in GPS radio frequency (RF) bandwidths, particularly when employing null-steering and beamforming technologies.? In many cases, the hardware and software interface between the GPS receiver and the antenna electronics is proprietary and dependent upon the vendor(s) represented.? This dependency restricts an aircraft platform?s ability to incorporate changes or upgrades to the PNT system without incurring appreciable cost and integration complexity increases associated with replacing either the AJ system, the PNT receiver, or integrated navigation Line Replaceable Units (LRU).? A more open system is intended to help counter this by providing an efficient means to modify the PNT system in response to evolving threats and updated requirements. Beyond the ?vendor lock? issue, the challenge of evolving threats and the resulting need to modify the current hardware and software may take nearly a decade to develop, test, produce, integrate, and field the next solution.? This duration is unacceptable when today?s threats are evolving at an accelerated pace.? To this end, the PNT PO is pursuing the development of a Multi-Global Navigation Satellite System (MGNSS)-capable Software Defined Receiver (SDR), known as SDUE, as well as compatible MGNSS antenna electronics, named Soteria. SDUE shall support adaptable, reprogrammable navigation solutions through the use of GPS military signals, Regional Military Protect (RMP) signals, non-GPS Satellite Navigation (SATNAV) signals, and others that may be available in the future. Soteria shall support AJ, which can take advantage of MGNSS signals, Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) signals, and flexible waveforms. The required Soteria capabilities are AJ, Anti-Spoof (AS), and Situational Awareness (SA) across the entire MGNSS/SATNAV spectrum, which encompasses all L-band frequencies. The data and control interface between Soteria and SDUE shall allow for the transmission/receipt of aiding and control data, signal and state selection messages, and beamformed data that will be required to support these capabilities. SDUE will receive from Soteria the processed I/Q beamformed measurements and nulling-only protected RF signals for all visible MGNSS satellites. Defining a physical and informational open standard for the Soteria interface is vital to employ advanced AJ/AS/SA capabilities in concert with the SDUE. It will promote competition based on performance and cost. In summary, the Government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical and physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols throughout the navigation architecture, addressing antenna subsystems and avionics architectures. Security Certified Software Defined Receiver and Standard Digital Interface The SDUE shall be a security certified, unclassified-when-keyed software defined SATNAV military receiver based on a field-programmable logic device technology (e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Array {FPGA}, Programmable Logic Device {PLD}, System on a Chip {SoC} FPGA). The design should be manufacturer-agnostic, shall implement the GPS security requirements set forth in GPU-PRD-711 and GPU-PRD-705, and comply with cyber requirements. The Government is projecting it can furnish an FPGA-based, security-certified architecture and associated intellectual property with Full/Government purpose data rights (as appropriate, and jointly agreed to) for the SDUE effort.? The security-certified architecture and intellectual property is currently being developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory under a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract with The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) on a project known as ?Janus?.? This architecture is expected to be security-certified by Dec 2025, in accordance with GPU-PRD-705. ?NOTE: An interim process/certification report will be available by late Summer 2023. Respondents are under no obligation to use what may be provided from the Janus effort to develop and deliver the required capabilities.? Respondents can use other secure, feasible, and efficient alternatives of the FPGA or devise their own architecture, as long as the Government can obtain data rights for the implemented architecture. As part of an Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD) effort, MITRE and The Ohio State University Antenna Electronics (OSU) teams are collaborating on the development of a standard interface and an interface control document (ICD). This will allow interoperability between MGNSS receivers and MGNSS beamsteering antennas, in order to break vendor lock scenarios and enable the effective and efficient insertion of new and advanced capabilities. The Government plans to engage industry to discuss the draft standard interface design with vendors, and to consider vendor inputs and recommendations, with the goal of defining a universally acceptable open interface standard. Operational Context Soteria, SDUE, and the Resilient-Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (R-EGI) are the three components that will collectively provide the Vanguard (first use) targeted capabilities necessary to deliver robust and resilient PNT to the warfighter. These three systems are envisioned to be nominally configured as shown in the attached document. The integrated capabilities of the proposed systems are shown as intended to support the effective and affordable operation of USAF, Joint/Coalition platforms, and weapon systems in evolving threat environments. It should be noted the three systems are expected to operate in a tightly coupled relationship, allowing aiding and the sharing of information to provide the desired resiliency and robustness while executing AS and SA functions. Hence, the Government is placing an emphasis on using non-proprietary open standard interfaces.

If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company or institution?s capabilities in meeting these requirements.? Failure to provide this documentation may prevent the Government from being able to assess your capabilities.? If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience or capabilities in order to perform that aspect of the requirement (i.e., through teaming or subcontracting). Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business applicants. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research.? Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged but not required. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) offerings, whether used as a contracting vehicle by a sole RFI responder or to RFI responders as part of a consortium, will be considered by the Government to achieve requirements.? RFI responders are requested to indicate any prior experience working under an OTA construct. RFI responders are requested to identify as a University Affiliated Research Center, if applicable. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, as identified on the final page of this RFI. As stated in the ?Department of Defense Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers?, version 1.1 (Jun 2013), the five principles of OSA are: Modular designs based on standards, with loose coupling and high cohesion, that allow for independent acquisition of system components. Enterprise investment strategies, based on collaboration and trust, that maximize reuse of proven hardware system designs and ensure we spend the least to get the best. Transformation of the life cycle sustainment strategies for software intensive systems through proven technology insertion and software product upgrade techniques. Dramatically lower development risk through transparency of system designs, continuous design disclosure, and Government, academia, and industry peer reviews. Strategic use of data rights to ensure a level competitive playing field and access to alternative solutions and sources, across the life cycle. As alluded to in principle 1. above, the establishment of an open Soteria standard (software and hardware) will allow one or more qualified third parties to add, modify, replace, remove, or provide support for the antenna electronics or the LRU independently. ?Moreover, while an architecture incorporating any physical layer configuration will be considered, preferred proposed solutions will minimize Group A changes, to maintain the form and fit of current antennas and antenna electronics components and connecting cables.? To this end, it will be valuable for RFI responders to present existing interface control documents, and/or to demonstrate a capability to generate a best of breed SDUE and Soteria interface solution from existing solutions or concepts. Interested parties shall provide information that demonstrates the following: Section A: New requests to address (beyond the original RFI questions) The first spiral of Soteria and SDUE, to be called the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), shall be based on the existing L1/L2 platform Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) capabilities (e.g., N79), and the use of L1/L2 GPS, L1/L2 QZSS, and Galileo E1 signals. Describe your approach and processes to satisfy the MVP requirements. Describe your approach and processes to upgrade the software and hardware (as needed) beyond the MVP requirements to allow capabilities that exploit the other MGNSS and Iridium signals existing in the band from 1160 MHz to 1627 MHz. NOTE: The Soteria SWAP is not to exceed the current ADAP SWAP.??The SDUE SWAP is not to exceed the current MGUE Inc.-I Aviation card SWAP. Given the existing SWAP and datalink limitations, describe the number of MGNSS signals to which your beamform can approach, and explain your plan to manage AJ for the remaining MGNSS signals. Describe your processes to maintain compatibility and synergy between Soteria and SDUE as new capabilities and updates are implemented in a manner to stay relevant in the evolving threat environment. It is expected that the insertion of Soteria, SDUE, and R-EGI into platforms will be staggered, for various technical and programmatic reasons. Describe your approach to enable modularity and interoperability among various combinations of CRPAs (existing and planned; for example, GSTAR, DIGAR, Soteria), GPS and MGNSS receiver modules (e.g., MGUE, SDUE), and/or PNT Line Replaceable Units (e.g., EGI-M, R-EGI).? All solutions should adhere to the principles of open systems architecture mentioned previously. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your preferred solution (which may use a teaming or prime/subcontractor plan)? Briefly describe your preferred approach and the elements involved (e.g., use of a Design Agent, prime contractor, or subcontractor) to execute the SDUE and Soteria acquisition program. NOTE: This question is optional. The Government is interested in the overall rapid prototyping cost. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for your proposed Development effort. Respondents are requested to provide a ROM estimate for the SDUE and Soteria rapid prototype phases, which can be provided as a range.

In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives.

Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) has measured muscle strength in study participants for over 20 years. Muscle strength is an important contributor to functional performance and is directly related to neurological and metabolic control mechanisms. NIA requires a unit that can measure strength eccentrically and concentrically to test leg strength in participants which is directly related to activities of daily living and remaining independent during aging. The current system, a Biodex System Pro, was purchased in 2009 and has reached the end of eligibility for annual service and maintenance contract. This purchase is to replace the current equipment. Since measuring change over time is critically important to the objectives of the BLSA, comparability of testing equipment and procedures to maintain continuity of data is essential. Purpose and Objectives: NIA requires an isokinetic dynamometer. ?The isokinetic dynamometer will need to include two dynamometers to test both legs independently and simultaneously. Project requirements: NIA requires an isokinetic dynamometer system with two dynamometers to test both legs independently and simultaneously.

The NCATS Early Translation Branch (ETB) collaborates with investigators at NIH and in the academic, biopharmaceutical and nonprofit sectors to generate probes for studying a diverse cross-section of human biology, focusing specifically on new targets and untreatable diseases. One of such untreatable diseases is Distal 5 Myopathy (MPD5) caused by mutation in ADSSL1 gene. This is an ultra-rare disease which we could not be found on the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) or any other rare disease databases. It causes a rapid onset of progression on the spam of two years. It makes patients challenging to climb stairs along with increasing difficulty with activities like getting up from a chair. His walking, foot drop due to which they sometimes trip, they have difficulty swallowing, and experience shortness of breath while walking. They also have dysphagia with masticatory dysfunction, proximal muscle weakness, distal muscle weakness, heart muscle disease, reduced lung volume, muscle wasting (dystrophic changes), muscle cell death (necrotizing skeletal myopathy), rimmed vacuoles, Drooping eyelids (bilateral ptosis), dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), facial muscle weakness (facial palsy), involuntary tight closure of the eyelids (blepharospasm), abnormal scarring (atrophic scars), stiff elbow joints (elbow flexion contracture), loss of ambulation This genetic mutation adversely impacts the conversion of IMP to AMP in the Purine Nucleotide Cycle. The goal is to conduct drug repurposing studies for MPD5 given that this myopathy results from impact on metabolic pathways. This requisition is to study further the biology of the mutation, which will help us develop compound screening campaigns. Purpose and Objectives: Reprogramed iPSCs isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with MPD5 Project requirements: Summary of Work.? For the whole blood sample designated by ETB for reprogramming expansion, contractor will isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and reprogram these cells into iPSCs as directed by the ETB.? Initially, a Master Cell Bank (MCB) of one clone with at least three (3) vials will be created per PBMC submitted and stored. Upon the successful creation of the MCB, two (2) vials will be shipped to ETB-specified collaborator location. One (1) additional vial of the MCB will be donated (submitted) to the National Institute for General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Cell Repository (NIGMS HGCR). These iPSCs will be subject to all regulations and terms of a submission to the NIGMS HGCR. Master Cell Bank ? Generation and Quality Control.? MCB Deemed Successful.? The MCB generation (expansion) will be deemed ""successful"" in respect of a iPSC line if (a) the number of vials of cells of such iPSC line specified above has been generated and (b) passed each MCB QC Test .? In the event of a QC Test failure, another vial from the frozen MCB will be used to repeat the QC Test. Master Cell Bank Quality Control Tests.? As part of MCB creation activities contractor will perform the following QC Tests: SeV Genome RT-PCR: SeV Genome assay is a RT-PCR assay with SeV genome sequence and transgene-specific primers that allows specific detection of transgenes carried by CytoTune 2.0 Sendai Virus reprogramming vectors to confirm loss of expression of Sendai genome and transgenes.? Viability: Viability is determined by measuring the area of five (5) colonies at first appearance (Day 1), then again within five (5) days. Colony doubling within five (5) days of the first appearance signifies a viable culture. Growth Rate: The MCB will be assessed for growth rate through colony doubling within five (5) days of first colony appearance. Mycoplasma: a sample of the MCB will be tested for mycoplasma using the MycoSEQ? Mycoplasma Detection Kit from ThermoFisher Scientific. This real-time PCR assay detects of >90 mycoplasma species with proven specificity and demonstrated sensitivity (detecting <10 copies per reaction). 6-Plex Short Tandem Repeat (STR): A sample of the MCB will undergo STR/identity analysis using Coriell?s 6-plex microsatellite assay. This is a short tandem repeat (STR) multiplex PCR assay. This single reaction amplifies six (6) tetranucleotide repeat loci and amelogenin, the gender-determination marker. Karyotyping: Twenty (20) metaphases will be counted; of these at least five (5) cells will be analyzed and examined microscopically for numerical and structural abnormalities. At least five (5) cells will be karyotyped. Results include International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) results with at least two (2) images of G-banded karyograms. Harvested cell pellets will be kept until ETB accepts the MCB, slides with dropped metaphases for analysis will be kept for one month, and copies of the digital records will be available for three (3) years after the creation of such record. Contractor?s criteria for failure of karyotype testing shall be defined by any of the following results: Of the initial twenty (20) cells that are counted and five (5) cells that are analyzed, if three (3) of the analyzed cells show the same abnormality, then ten (10) additional cells will be assessed. If one (1) more cell, for a total of 4 analyzed cells, contains the same abnormality, then the line is deemed abnormal. If contractor deems an iPSC line to have failed Karyotyping, ETB shall have the option to request an additional karyotyping QC test at an additional cost.? The parties agree to discuss in good faith any karyotyping QC issues and any potential resolution prior to an iPSC line to be deemed to have failed Karyotyping. If a certain abnormality was found in a previous study (parent line, sister line, or expansion), the line fails. If the total non-clonal abnormalities ?25%, the line fails. SNP 6.0 Genotyping: a MCB sample will be analyzed using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (SNP CGH Array) in CORIELL's genotyping center. Upon detection of cytogenomic abnormalities, lines will fail at the discretion of the cytogenomics consultant. Embryoid Body (EB) Formation from Undifferentiated Cells and RT-PCR to confirm trilineage differentiation potential: EB formation assay will be conducted using undifferentiated iPS cells and it will be followed for ten (10) days in culture. After ten (10) days, embryoid bodies (EBs) will be harvested followed by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-PCR assay to detect the expression of genes in all three (3) germ layers. Expression of at least one gene per germ layer is required for confirming pluripotency.? Alkaline Phosphatase (AP): Staining will be conducted using the StemTAG Alkaline Phosphatase Staining kit from Cell Biolabs to confirm that the culture is within the desired limit of undifferentiated stem cells as a high level of AP and high AP activity are traditional markers of pluripotent stem cells. Cell Surface Antigen Expression: Analysis will be conducted by flow cytometry using SSEA 3 and SSEA 4 staining.? Flow cytometry is also performed if an abnormal morphology is observed throughout the culturing process in order to confirm that the culture is within the desired limit of undifferentiated iPS cells. Storage, Distribution, and Destruction of MCB.? Two (2) vials of successfully established MCB vials will be shipped to ETB or ETB-desired recipient upon completion.

NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING REQUESTED UNDER THIS NOTICE. This Sources Sought Notice is for market research purposes to identify interested firms for the potential requirement detailed below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing) and the size standard is 1,000 employees. The Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition. Note: The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 8301-05) is the primary federal procurement law providing a preference for domestic goods and manufactured products. As such, the USGS is seeking information on sources that can supply the described instrument either mined, produced or manufactured in the U.S. in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of satisfactory quality. Background: A robotics-based instrument is needed to perform unattended, automated analysis of up to three water quality parameters ? pH, specific conductance (or conductivity, herein), and alkalinity ? for unfiltered water samples; and three parameters ? pH, conductivity, and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC; an alkalinity equivalent measurement not otherwise noted herein) ? for filtered water samples. This instrument will replace two separate instruments currently used by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) to independently measure each of these parameters. The instrument is needed to increase the efficiency in the analysis of these three parameters in approximately 17,000 water samples per year (samples/y) for pH and (or) conductivity; and 6,000 samples/y for alkalinity, including by custom procedures designed for low specific conductance samples. These analyses support studies conducted nationwide by the USGS Water Mission Area. An instrument is needed that can be programmed to select which of the measurements are performed on any given sample as described below. Requirements: The instrument shall provide the following functional, operational, and performance capabilities: 1. The system, including measurement instrumentation and components provided by third-party sources used to assemble the complete system, shall be new. Demonstration units or used systems will not be accepted. 2. The system shall be able to perform unattended, automated sample manipulation and measurements, without manual inputs needed during a sequence of multiple sample analyses, using a robotics-based sampler design that includes the additional components and analytical measurement instruments and capabilities specified herein. 3. The system shall be controlled for unattended, automated sample analysis of the measured parameters by vendor-supplied software (system software) operated on a USGS-supplied computer with Windows 10 (or later) operating system. 4. The system shall include one or more sample manipulators that move in XYZ (3-dimensional) space to allow manipulator movement between samples that are manually placed into one or more sample racks prior to beginning unattended, automated analysis. 5. The manipulator(s) shall be fitted with a stirrer for mixing of the sample prior to within-sample container measurement of pH and conductivity, and prior to withdrawal of sample aliquots that are used for measurement of alkalinity in a separate titration vessel (cell) as described below. The stir rate shall be adjustable and controlled by the system software. 6. The sample container shall contain the sample used to complete measurements of pH, conductivity, and/or alkalinity and have sufficient volume to allow withdrawal of replicate aliquot volumes needed for at least two discrete alkalinity measurements. The alkalinity measurement is performed in a separate alkalinity titration vessel (see below). 7. The vendor shall provide estimates of the maximum volume of sample and aliquots required to complete the pH, conductivity, and replicate alkalinity measurements to inform total sample volume requirements for the container. 8. The sample container shall be made of plastic (polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene) and fitted with a non-leaking plastic screw cap and be of free-standing tapered vial design or flat bottom design as vendor determines is optimum for reliably and accurately making the required measurements using the system. The container(s) shall be capable of performing the dual role of being the water sample container used during field collection followed by direct placement into the robotic system?s rack to commence measurements (after manually uncapping the container) to eliminate the need for sample pour-up into a different container prior to analysis on the system. 9. The sample container shall be of a common, commercially available type to help ensure continuous, adequate supply over time and not exceed $3.00 per container at the time of this procurement. The vendor identified container must be directly available from distributor(s) that allow direct purchase by the Government of large quantities of containers for both field and laboratory use. 10. Upon vendor selection, the vendor shall coordinate with NWQL staff to finalize selection of an appropriate container. Conductivity and pH measurement specifications: 1. The manipulator(s) shall be fitted with probes for measuring pH and conductivity of the water sample within the sample container positioned on the system rack(s) to facilitate rapid measurement of pH and conductivity on at least 20 samples per hour (samples/h) when only those two parameters are being measured. 2. pH shall be measured using a pH electrode (probe) of type that conforms with standard capabilities as given in Standard Method 4500-H+ B, EPA Method 9040C, USGS I-2587-85, with temperature monitoring and correction of the measured pH. 3. Conductivity shall be measured using a specific conductance probe of type that conforms with the standard capabilities as given in Standard Method 2510 B, USGS I-2781-85, and reporting in units of microsiemens per centimeter (?S/cm) with wide measurement range (for example, 5 to 20,000 ?S/cm at 25?C). 4. The system shall include an automated mechanism for wet storage of pH and conductivity probes (in probe manufacturers? recommended storage solutions) on the robotic system when not in active use during a run sequence (for example, when only alkalinity is measured in the sequence) and especially upon completion of a sequence at night or over a weekend. Alkalinity measurement specifications: 1. The instrument used shall determine alkalinity by titration of an aliquot of either a filtered or unfiltered water sample using procedures that conform to USGS method I-2030-85, Standard Method 2320B and EPA 310.1, with software options that allow for user-defined use of pH endpoint or inflection point methods and calculations for the alkalinity determination. 2. Measurement of alkalinity shall be performed using a separate titration cell/vessel and not be performed within the sample container on the system rack. 3. The stirred aliquot (defined by volume, not weight) of sample used for alkalinity titration shall be taken from the sample container from which the pH and conductivity measurements are made using probes on the manipulator(s). The procedure used shall allow for at least one repeat aliquot sampling from the sample container to perform either a discrete replicate alkalinity titration measurement for the sample or, if needed, a discrete measurement on a dilution of the sample. 4. The system software shall be able to determine if a sample dilution is necessary based on the initial total alkalinity measurement in milligrams of CaCO3 per liter (mg CaCO3/L) of water and automatically prepare a dilution of a new aliquot of the sample for subsequent alkalinity determination that will fall within the instrument calibration (defined measurement) range. 5. The system software shall record and store the titration curve for each sample to allow user review. 6. The sample aliquot used for the alkalinity measurement shall be directed to waste and not returned to the sample container to minimize contamination of the system flow path. 7. The system shall be capable of achieving a method detection limit of 4 mg CaCO3/L or lower. Other system requirements: 1. The system shall be able to perform automated preparation of calibration and continuing calibration verification [CCV] working standards from stock standard solutions. 2. The system shall perform automated dilution(s) and reanalysis within a run sequence, or as an immediate follow-on sequence, for any samples having results that exceed the upper calibration range such that the dilution result will fall within the calibration range. 3. The system shall perform automated rinsing of all components of the manipulator(s) (including probes, stirrers, aliquot sippers), alkalinity titration cell, and sample flow path tubing of the system between every sample to ensure sample cross-contamination does not occur throughout an entire analysis sequence. 4. The system shall include a flowing (not static) rinsing mechanism for thorough rinsing with deionized water between each water sample of the pH probe, conductivity probe, stirrer(s), sample aliquot sipper, all sample flow lines, titration cell, and all other aspects of the system flow paths. This rinse volume (rinse time) shall be user defined within the system software with all waste rinse water transported to at least one separate, large waste container. It is desired that the system be able to perform real-time monitoring (with data storage) of system cleanliness and automatically control rinse time (rinse volume) by, for example, measurement of conductivity during the rinse step performed between each sample in the sequence. 5. The system shall be capable of unattended (?walk-away?) processing of at least 80 samples within a run sequence over an 8 hour or less period when measuring pH, conductivity, and alkalinity. Note: this requirement presumes a uniform time for alkalinity titration for all samples in the sequence. 6. The system shall be capable of readily using different rack configurations (to accommodate different container sizes, number of samples per rack, and multiple rack use) by selection of rack type and number of racks within the system software. 7. System shall have the power requirements of 100-120 V. 8. Operational ability (relative to system design and components including software) to readily add additional measurement capabilities into the robotics system in the future, such as measurement of turbidity, color, hardness etc. and perform sample filtration. 9. System software/control also shall include the ability to: 1. Input sample (including QC sample types) lists using a barcode reader or from a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) (import from LIMS via comma separated values (CSV; preferred) or tab delimited file format) for samples requiring measurement of any of the parameters per sample. 2. Monitor sample measurements and sequence status and to pause the sequence to add new samples to the sequence, to add parameter measurements for samples not yet analyzed in the sequence, and to add reagents, or, if needed, to terminate the sequence prior to sequence completion with system retention of all acquired measurement results prior to termination. 3. Create and store multiple analytical methods. 4. Define quality control samples at user-specified intervals or sequence positions. 5. Select parameters to be measured per sample. 6. Run the instrument unattended once samples and stock standards or working calibrants are placed into the rack(s), reagents are readied, and the sequence is started. The instrument must not stop advancing to subsequent samples in the sequence due to difficulty measuring pH on a sample with low conductivity. The system shall record the occurrence of inability to acquire a measurable pH for any sample. 7. Record and report operational conditions and run audit information for each sequence including at least sample identification number, sample type, sample analysis date and time (date-time stamp) for each parameter measured, probe identification numbers, identification and concentrations of calibrators, calibration models used, and user-defined quality control (measure range, accuracy) criteria, and an audit trail with date and time stamp of instrument errors. 8. Flag results that fall outside of user-defined operation specifications and quality control criteria. 9. Perform automated re-analysis of groups of samples based on performance of bracketing QC samples in the event of a failure in one or both bracketing QC sample. 10. Sound alarms to alert the operator to a problem, or initiate shutdown procedures for the system when critical system or measurement failures are detected by system sensors. 11. Provide all sample results and operational meta data for the sequence run, including calibration and quality control sample results, in comma delimited (.csv; preferred) or fixed field (ASCII .txt) file format that can be user modified and that can be direct imported (reported) to a LIMS, Excel spreadsheet, stored on a data server, and that can be printed, including as pdf file format. 12.

The Government proposes to issue a firm-fixed-price type contract for this project. ? THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT FROM RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, NOR DOES IT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO PRODUCE A SOLICITATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY INTERESTED PARTIES IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY AND NO MONETARY COMPENSATION WILL BE PROVIDED FOR RESPONSE PREPARATION OR FOLLOW UP REQUESTS. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain insight into the interest, capabilities, and qualifications of business firms to perform Water Intake Repairs of this complexity and magnitude and to determine if there is adequate competition to compete and successfully perform. The anticipated period of performance is 365 days from Notice to Proceed. This is a high-visibility action with immediate need. The anticipated award date is 15 September 2022. The scope of the requirement includes construction of a repair or replacement weir for the existing water intake weir in the Big Piney River with a service life of 10 years. Weir repair or replacement will be designed to maintain the current water pool requirements for the water intake and includes up & down stream cofferdams, containment walls, and weir injection, as needed. Construction of the weir repair or replacement must be within the current environmental permitting, Nationwide Permit 3, for the existing weir. An aquatic organism passage will be included as part of the weir design per environmental requirements, Section 7 Consultation, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. The existing canoe portage path is to be replaced as needed to install the new weir and aquatic organism bypass. Dewatering permissible with approval from 1 April to 1 November. Background: The original weir for the water intake was constructed in the early 1940s, the design drawing is dated September 1942. Historical images from the bridge construction downstream of the weir in 1957 show the weir in the background. From these images it looks like the original weir was replaced with a rock covered earthen berm. It is possible that soil and rock simply accumulated onto the original concrete weir, but we assumed a worse case of the original weir being removed or washed out. In 1986 the weir was raised and repaired. The raise consisted of placing additional soil and rock fill on the existing earthen berm then placing gabion baskets and a concrete cap. The bank slopes also had gabion basket protection placed on them when the weir was raised. Fish passage was one of the concerns listed in the 1986 404 permit, but fish passage was not incorporated into the weir repair. The water intake weir has deteriorated since the 1986 repair. The concrete cap has several large cracks in the surface, the gabion baskets below the cap can be seen in locations, and some pieces of the downstream edge of the concrete weir cap have broken off. The gabion baskets have also deteriorated, many are missing rock material or have broken open. During boring it was observed that there are large voids under the concrete cap and water was flowing through the weir. ACQUISITION STRATEGY The Government anticipates a one-year, firm-fixed-price type contract for this project. The requirement is to Repair the Water Intake Weir at Big Piney on Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. The magnitude of this project is between $4,000,000 and $8,000,000. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 237990-Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, $39.5M size standard. COVER LETTER: 1. Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address. 2. Firm's Unique Entity Identifier. 3. Offeror's interest in providing a proposal if a solicitation is issued. 4.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) Flight Operations Directorate (FOD) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Integrated Mission Operations Contract III (IMOC III) solicitation. JSC is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis/Request For Information (RFI) as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA IMOC II, contract #NNJ14RA01B. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the type and method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541715, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biology) Except, Guided Missiles and Space Vehicles, Their Propulsion Units and Propulsion Parts; under this NAICS code a business is considered small if its number of employees is less than 1,250. NASA JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the IMOC III solicitation. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and there is no solicitation at this time. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred and the respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in sam.gov. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website and https://www.nasa.gov/jsc/procurement/imoc3 for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. IMOC III Description: It is anticipated that the IMOC III will be a Single-Award, 100% Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to cost-plus-fixed-fee and/or firm-fixed-price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the Draft IMOC III Statement of Work is attached to this posting. A summary of content for the proposed IMOC III contract includes, but is not limited to, the following: To provide support and products for spaceflight operations capability development and execution for the JSC FOD and the International Space Station Program (ISSP): Avionics and Software Office (OD). This includes support to mission preparation (Plan), crew, flight controller, instructor, and analyst training (Train), and real-time mission execution (Fly) activities related to exploration operations and the International Space Station operations. Operations capability development support is required from the contractor as NASA defines operations requirements associated with the emerging options for the exploration initiatives and potential new programs, including, but not limited the Artemis Program (Orion Spacecraft, the Space Launch System Program, Exploration Ground Systems, Gateway, Lunar Landers and Excursion Vehicles), Commercial Crew and Cargo, Commercial Low Earth Orbit, and advanced technology and research. IMOC III requirements may include, but are not limited to, services such as: Contract Management and Administration Operations Support for Vehicle / System / Program Design and Development Mission Preparation (Plan) including Technical Integration, Product Development, Mission Analysis, and Mission and Training Systems Support Mission Training (Train) Development, Planning, Documentation, and Execution Mission Execution (Fly) including Real-Time Mission Support and Postflight Analysis Astronaut Office and CAPCOM Support Avionics and Software Integration, Coordination, And Support Activities The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: KBR Wyle Services, LLC Contract Number: NNJ14RA01B Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $1.3 billion Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2023 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the draft IMOC III SOW. Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: ?Name and address of firm Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) Size of business Average annual revenue for past three years Number of employees Whether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a Number of years in business Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners If you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor? A list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on April 25, 2022. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice/RFI must be emailed to jsc-imoc3@mail.nasa.gov . An Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

Introduction This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested. Purpose The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a firm-fixed priced purchase order on a sole source basis with Joynson Mechanical Services LLC located at 5888 Ontario Center Road, Ontario, New York, 14519-8640. The purchase order will be for environmental chamber maintenance services for a three-year period of performance.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219 ? Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance with a size standard of $22 Million. Description Please see the attached Statement of Work for details. Sole Source Determination The sole source determination is based on the following: ? The NIST Infrastructure Materials Group (IMG), in cooperation with industry, performs research to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationship between chemistry, microstructure, performance, and service life of conventional and high-performance concrete and other inorganic building materials. This work involves the synergetic combination of both experimental and computational materials science research. NIST owns and uses environmental chambers to fulfill this mission. The owned environmental chambers were custom manufactured for NIST by Russells Technical Products to store samples/specimens under precise conditions. These procedures specify conditions so that data can be compared to data collected by other laboratories.? The chambers have been in use for research purposes since February 2012. It is imperative that the chambers are properly maintained to ensure scientific research is not negatively impacted. After manufacturing and delivering the custom chambers to NIST, Russells Technical Products authorized only one company, now known as Joynson Mechanical Services, LLC, to install and service the equipment. This contractor has performed all maintenance and calibration since 2012 and remains the only contractor capable of providing maintenance and calibration services. No other contractor is authorized or has the necessary proprietary information to service the custom equipment. Accordingly, only Joynson Mechanical Services, LLC is capable of meeting NIST's requirements. ?

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices. Submitted documents shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. Proposal Contents: COVER LETTER - Shall not exceed 2 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: AOI for which proposal is submitted (number and title) Company name, physical address, mailing address, and website URL Note: CSO is a streamlined acquisition process -- The Government intends to evaluate proposals on a rolling basis up until 9 Sep 2022, and as applicable, execute awards NLT 48 hours after receipt of proposals.

Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the solicitation or amendments. A proposal is acceptable if it conforms to all material requirements of the CSO, otherwise it is unacceptable and may be ineligible for award. **Note: Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to this solicitation are reviewed carefully prior to submitting a proposal. The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ?

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices. Submitted documents shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. Proposal Contents: COVER LETTER - Shall not exceed 2 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: AOI for which proposal is submitted (number and title) Company name, physical address, mailing address, and website URL Note: CSO is a streamlined acquisition process -- The Government intends to evaluate proposals on a rolling basis up until 9 Sep 2022, and as applicable, execute awards NLT 48 hours after receipt of proposals.

Offerors shall identify their small business size and socio-economic status, as well as small business size and socio-economic status of any proposed team members or subcontractors under the NAICS identified in this paragraph or the NAICS the offeror believes would be appropriate pursuant to FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations (September 2021). Socio-economic status refers to status as a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone small business concerns, and any related identifications. Questions All questions related to this CSO and its AOI may be submitted in writing via email on a rolling basis. Questions and solutions pertinent to this CSO shall be sent to both matthew.brien.1@us.af.mil and lucas.cristaldi@us.af.mil. Proposal Submission This is an ?Open CSO,? meaning the CSO will accept proposals until 9 Sep 2022, or until an award has been made.? Proposals are reviewed, at a minimum, every 60 days, beginning 1 Jan 2022.? The first cutoff date for proposals to be eligible for the February review is 6 Feb 2022.? The Open CSO will be amended to provide future cutoff dates. The final deadline for receipt of proposals in response to this Open CSO is NLT 8:00am Eastern Daylight Time, 9 Sep 2022. Offerors may submit proposal amendments any time prior to the proposal deadline specified herein, however 23 CONS will ONLY review the final amended proposal that is submitted. Please ensure that your e-mail address listed in your proposal is current and accurate. 23 CONS is not responsible for ensuring notifications are received by firms changing mailing address/e-mail address/company points of contact after proposal submission without proper notification to 23 CONS. Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the solicitation or amendments. A proposal is acceptable if it conforms to all material requirements of the CSO, otherwise it is unacceptable and may be ineligible for award. **Note: Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to this solicitation are reviewed carefully prior to submitting a proposal. The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Further funding discussions will be contained the AOI. Notifications of Award and Protests Unsuccessful offerors shall receive notification of award and small business status of awardees.? Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ?

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices. Submitted documents shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. Proposal Contents: COVER LETTER - Shall not exceed 2 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: AOI for which proposal is submitted (number and title) Company name, physical address, mailing address, and website URL Note: CSO is a streamlined acquisition process -- The Government intends to evaluate proposals on a rolling basis up until 9 Sep 2022, and as applicable, execute awards NLT 48 hours after receipt of proposals. Proposal validity statement, a minimum of 90 days is required. Authorized representative or point(s) of contact Brief introduction to company and history/expertise with proposed AOI CAGE code, DUNS number, NAICS code for this requirement and socioeconomic representation(s) under said NAICS SAM.gov screenshot to confirm current registration Relevant NAICS code and description for AOI proposal Note: The Government reserves the right to not consider a proposal for award if it omits any of the required information. TECHNICAL WHITE PAPER - Shall not exceed 5 pages in PDF format (8.5x11?), and shall include the following: Substantive description of the technical solution in sufficient detail to allow 23 CONS to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution.

Changes of this nature shall be annotated in the solicitation or amendments. A proposal is acceptable if it conforms to all material requirements of the CSO, otherwise it is unacceptable and may be ineligible for award. **Note: Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to this solicitation are reviewed carefully prior to submitting a proposal. The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Further funding discussions will be contained the AOI. Notifications of Award and Protests Unsuccessful offerors shall receive notification of award and small business status of awardees.? Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO.

Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest. As with any award, price is always a factor and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness so offers are reminded to provide solutions at competitive prices.

The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments.

The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO.

The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified Small Business concerns including 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.? However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NCI?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. BACKGROUND The NCI Clinical Pharmacology Program (CPP) requires the use of accurate mass (weight) measurements of drugs in order to accurately quantify drugs in patient samples which are used to adjust patient doses on clinical trials for the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In order to be able to effectively and accurately adjust patient doses, CPP needs reliable data which originates with accurate mass (weight) measurements of the drug itself. The current analytical balance is only rated by the US Pharmacopeia (USP) as 99% accurate down to 10 mg. This sensitivity level is no longer acceptable, as drugs become more potent and lower doses are needed for certain drugs. The current balance is over 15 years old and is no longer compliant with US Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for low mass (weight) accuracy. A new analytical balance is necessary in order for the CPP lab to maintain capability to keep up with the new drugs being developed by the CCR clinical trials. A modern analytical balance will afford CPP a 10-fold increase in sensitivity allowing for accuracy of drug stocks used to measure these drug concentrations in patient samples. This is of paramount importance because drug measurements that come from assays using this analytical balance are directly used to adjust patient doses. TYPE OF ORDER This shall be issued as a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order. SPECIAL ORDER REQUIREMENTS PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS The following product features/characteristics are required for this requirement: Must have a sensitivity of less than 2 mg and 99.9% accuracy per USP.

Offerors are reminded that certain existing contractual arrangements may preclude, restrict or limit participation, in whole or in part, either as a subcontractor or as a prime contractor under this competitive procurement.? Of primary concern are those contractual arrangements in which the Offeror provides support to Northwest Regional Maintenance Center, or related laboratories (if applicable), in support of operation of the office or any of its programs.? General guidance may be found in FAR 9.505; however, this guidance is not all-inclusive.? The Offeror's attention is directed to the ""Organizational Conflict of Interest"" (OCI) or similar requirement which may be contained in current or completed contract(s) which prohibits the prime or subcontractor from providing certain supplies or services to the Government as described above during the period of the current ""support"" contract(s) or for a period after completion of the ""support"" contract(s).?

For example, a potential conflict may arise if former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror may have gained access to nonpublic information about a competitor through participation in previous or ongoing performance or during the solicitation development/source selection process associated with this competitive procurement, and then participates in the formation of the Offeror?s proposal.? Other potential conflicts of interest may arise where either the former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror under this competitive procurement set the ground rules for competition; for example, by drafting specifications or assisting in the drafting of the statement of work. General guidance may be found in FAR 3.101 and 9.505; however, this guidance is not all-inclusive.? (c)? If an Offeror identifies a potential conflict of interest that exists at any tier, that Offeror is requested to notify the Contracting Officer within 14 days of the date of this solicitation.?

The Government may independently verify the information received from the Offeror.? The requirement to identify potential conflicts of interest as outlined herein continues until contract award.? Notwithstanding the above, the Government reserves the right to determine whether a conflict of interest exists based on any information received from any source.? (d)? The Government will notify an Offeror of any conflict of interest within 14 days of receipt of all required information.? Those Offerors deemed to have a conflict of interest may be ineligible for award.?

This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (large business, small business, 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.), relative to NAICS code 811210 (size standard of $22 million). Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. Background: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation, Stem Cell Translational Laboratory (SCTL) is a state-of-the-art research facility within NCATS? Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation is dedicated to addressing the scientific and technological challenges in the iPSC field. Specifically, the SCTL aims to develop a renewable supply of human cell-based models focusing on new patient-derived iPSC lines that give rise to specialized, functional nerve cells that are relevant for opioid misuse, addiction, and pain. ??? Single-cell sequencing methods have become widely used in every project that the SCTL has pursued to date. The SCTL has developed protocols for derivation of multiple major novel cell types from human pluripotent stem cells (embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells), such as nociceptor cells, multiple subtypes of neurons, astrocytes, glial cells, or trophectodermal/trophoblast cells. In the past year, organoid cultures have been added to the list of routinely used techniques. At the same time, the SCTL is in the process of starting a number of collaborations with external expert research groups. These collaborations expand the in-vitro models by a number of novel cell types and methods. For all of these, single-cell sequencing applications are a cornerstone. Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase a one (1) year Assurance Plan for the 10X Genomics Chromium Connect, with an option for an additional one (1) year contract. The Chromium Connect by 10X Genomics is a platform for automation of single-cell library construction workflows, such as 3' RNA sequencing, ATAC sequencing or DNA copy number variant analysis. These workflows offer insight into transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes on the single-cell level with unprecedented detail, however, they are extremely laborious. A single library preparation protocol for 1 to 8 samples for 3' RNA sequencing application can take a skilled researcher as many as 3 or more days. Automation of the protocols minimizes hands-on time and greatly increases sample throughput. Additionally, it leads to standardization of the procedures and virtually eliminates technical variation. The Assurance Plan ensures the Chromium Connect is operating optimally, is serviced annually, and any issues can be addressed in a timely manner.

 Consulting: Architectural and Engineering,MD,Architect Engineer Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (A/E IDIQ) Environmental Services Contract,Federal,,Department of Defense,"Jun 27, 2022",Department of Defense,https://sam.gov/opp/73816fc51faf474b9031c6a53e1d61ca/view,"W912DR22R0023    		    		 ",Purchasing,,703-695-7145,Leigha.M.Arnold@usace.army.mil,,Hub zone Set Asides,"CONTRACT INFORMATION. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District (NAB) plans to award a target of eight (8) separate Architect/Engineer (A/E) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to comprise one (1) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for A/E services to support Hazardous, Toxic, Radioactive Waste (HTRW) and Military Munitions (MM) projects. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and agency supplements. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The A/E Services will support various, nationwide environmental support projects. The contracts will be used for projects within USACE's NAD mission AOR, with incidental utilization in the contiguous United States and in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, excluding Europe, in support of other USACE regions. The approximately eight (8) IDIQs will be negotiated and awarded with a five (5)-year ordering period. In accordance with FAR 19.503, Reserves, this acquisition is being issued under one synopsis as an Unrestricted MATOC with a Small Business Reserve. The capacity of these contracts will be a combined $200M shared amongst all firms awarded contracts. USACE will award a minimum of three (3) unrestricted contracts and a minimum of three (3) Small Business contracts of any socioeconomic category. The target number of awards within each category (Large and Small Business) is four (4) contracts per category. Task orders will be competed amongst the MATOC holder?s A/E Selection procedures pursuant to FAR Subpart 36.6 in accordance with EP 715-1-7, the USACE Task Order Requirements Notification (TORN) Process, and FAR 16.505(b)(1). Small Business MATOC holders will be considered for all task orders. Unrestricted MATOC holders will be considered on task orders that are not reserved for Small Businesses. The minimum guarantee amount over the life is $5,000 for each of the MATOC contracts. Awards will be made under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541330, Engineering Services. This code currently defines the Small Business size standard as $16.5M of gross annual revenues.? The Small Business Administration is proposing to update this size standard definition in 2022 but has not yet been made.? Determination of which pool a firm is to be evaluated in (Large or Small Business) will be made based on the size standard in effect as of a selection decision by Baltimore District.? An amendment notifying firms of any change in the NAICS 541330 size standard will be issued for this synopsis should that determination be made during the solicitation period.? Firms should structure their SF330 submission accordingly. Awards are anticipated by August 2022. A firm can submit a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontractor to a Large Business on the unrestricted award. However, the Agency's intent is that a particular offeror may only receive one (1) award as a prime contractor under this IDIQ. For example, if the same firm submits as a Prime on both the Small Business reserve and the unrestricted award, the firm can only obtain one (1) award of an IDIQ, not two (2).??Secondly, while there is no proscription against a firm submitting a proposal as a Prime on the Small Business reserve and as a teaming subcontracting on the unrestricted award. We do note that being both a prime and subcontractor on an IDIQ can sometimes raise risks in the technical evaluation, and potential questions regarding Organizational Conflicts of Interest, if both entities decide to propose on the same task order. For example, if a firm is a key subcontractor for five different proposals, it could raise questions in regards to whether the firm had the total resources to support each procurement, which could impact the technical evaluation of the offerors.? If selected for negotiation, large businesses will be required to submit subcontracting plans that address small business utilization and provide maximum practicable opportunities to Small Business (SB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) , Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUB Zone), Small Disadvantaged, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Black College University (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) and Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB). If USACE finds a prospective firm to be non-compliant with their subcontracting plans on previous contracts, the firm may not be eligible for award under this synopsis. Small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans as part of their response. The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal but will be required with the price proposal of the large firms selected. To be eligible for a contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov. Inherently governmental functions will not be performed by firms per FAR Part 7.5. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Baltimore District; however, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to approve capacity requests from other Districts outside of the Baltimore Districts mission boundaries to support USACE missions, when advantageous to the Government. In accordance with FAR section 36.604 and the supplements thereto, and upon final acceptance or termination, a performance evaluation will be prepared at least annually and at the time the task order is completed for all task orders above $35,000. A performance evaluation may be prepared for task orders below $35,000. interim performance evaluations may be prepared for a task order at any time. Performance evaluations will be maintained for use in future source selections for A-E services. (1) PROJECT INFORMATION.

The Air Force Lifecycle Management Center, Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Chief Architect Integration Office (CAIO) releases the Broad Agency Announcement for Advanced Battle Management Systems (ABMS) Announcement Number: BAA-AFLCMC_CAIO-2020-0001 Issue Date: 28 February 2020 NOTE This is only an announcement; PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE. Subsequent calls will be issued under this announcement to solicit proposals for specific efforts. Please refer to the attachment section of this announcement for the calls.? Publication of this announcement does not obligate the DoD to review any white papers submission beyond an initial administrative review, or to award any specific project, or to obligate any available funds. Executive Summary In order to effectively engage peer and near-peer adversaries, the U.S. Air Force needs to develop, acquire and operate systems as a unified force across all domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber, and electromagnetic spectrum).? The Department of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office (DAFRCO) in partnership with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Architecture and Integration Directorate (AFLCMC/XA) seeks to develop a cross-cutter portfolio of complimentary/ linked projects and programs to support Joint All-Domain Command & Control (JADC2) and the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). The Air Force intends to facilitate the rapid exploration and maturation of innovative?technologies. The Air Force will support future operations by providing the critical surveillance, tactical edge communications, processing, networking, and battle management command and control capabilities to the joint warfighting force.? ABMS is not envisioned as a single program of record, but rather an open architecture family of systems that enables capabilities via multiple integrated platforms.? ABMS will realize the vision of JADC2 to enhance and expand capabilities by enabling any sensor to inform any shooter in any domain?land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. ?In an interview with Air Force Magazine in April 2019, General Goldfein stated, ?It is a significant move for the Air Force to shift from a platform solution on command and control and battle management to a network solution going forward, and our future in the business of joint warfighting is to ensure that we?re taking every sensor and every shooter and connecting them together to overwhelm an adversary?.? Our aim is to have intelligence and targeting data transformed into timely and actionable information through trusted networks and intelligent algorithms that enable our people to focus on decisions.? In this construct, information is a service, rather than a platform, and the layers of sensing and the communication pathways will provide reliability and assurance in contested environments.

This capability includes a new software defined receiver with a Program of Record (PoR) designation as ?Software Defined User Equipment (SDUE)? and a new digital resilient antenna electronics (RAE) package with a PoR designation of ?Soteria?.? ? An RFI for SDUE was previously posted on 02 Jul 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/47e113d4819c478c95984964d068b6fa/view. An RFI for Aircraft Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE) (now Soteria) was previously posted on 17 Dec 2020 at: https://sam.gov/opp/fbbd846e765840ee85dd66bfd0558899/view. These RFIs were originally focused on developing the SDUE and Soteria as two separate acquisition programs. The Government now believes developing the SDUE and Soteria together as a single acquisition program will provide a lower risk approach and ensure effective interface compatibility between SDUE and Soteria. If you previously responded to these RFIs and your prior responses are still valid, then please state that your previous responses are still accurate and complete.? If you wish to provide any new or updated information to your previous RFI responses (or if you did not respond before), please provide your comments to any of the questions in the original RFI?s, as found at the links shown above.? ?? The Government is evaluating options for a planned Middle Tier Acquisition (MTA) effort that may use Other Transaction Authority (OTA) and the selection of a Design Agent (DA) to lead a rapid prototyping and rapid production requirements effort. The Government would like to understand prime contractor interest in accomplishing the total effort in-house or using subcontractor arrangements as necessary.? Additionally, the Government would like to understand SDUE contractor interest in accomplishing the SDUE development/rapid prototyping effort.? Similarly, the Government would like to understand Soteria contractor interest in accomplishing the Soteria development/rapid prototyping effort. Purpose/Description? Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on precise Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) for a wide range of military operations. Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provide Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) data in support of this, but must be designed to ensure performance in operational environments. Currently fielded GPS receivers contribute to this necessary capability but are susceptible to degradation in electronic threat (e.g., jamming, spoofing) environments.? Advanced Anti-Jam (AJ) antenna and/or antenna electronics systems may be leveraged to reduce electronic interference in GPS radio frequency (RF) bandwidths, particularly when employing null-steering and beamforming technologies.? In many cases, the hardware and software interface between the GPS receiver and the antenna electronics is proprietary and dependent upon the vendor(s) represented.? This dependency restricts an aircraft platform?s ability to incorporate changes or upgrades to the PNT system without incurring appreciable cost and integration complexity increases associated with replacing either the AJ system, the PNT receiver, or integrated navigation Line Replaceable Units (LRU).? A more open system is intended to help counter this by providing an efficient means to modify the PNT system in response to evolving threats and updated requirements. Beyond the ?vendor lock? issue, the challenge of evolving threats and the resulting need to modify the current hardware and software may take nearly a decade to develop, test, produce, integrate, and field the next solution.? This duration is unacceptable when today?s threats are evolving at an accelerated pace.? To this end, the PNT PO is pursuing the development of a Multi-Global Navigation Satellite System (MGNSS)-capable Software Defined Receiver (SDR), known as SDUE, as well as compatible MGNSS antenna electronics, named Soteria. SDUE shall support adaptable, reprogrammable navigation solutions through the use of GPS military signals, Regional Military Protect (RMP) signals, non-GPS Satellite Navigation (SATNAV) signals, and others that may be available in the future. Soteria shall support AJ, which can take advantage of MGNSS signals, Navigation Technology Satellite-3 (NTS-3) signals, and flexible waveforms. The required Soteria capabilities are AJ, Anti-Spoof (AS), and Situational Awareness (SA) across the entire MGNSS/SATNAV spectrum, which encompasses all L-band frequencies. The data and control interface between Soteria and SDUE shall allow for the transmission/receipt of aiding and control data, signal and state selection messages, and beamformed data that will be required to support these capabilities. SDUE will receive from Soteria the processed I/Q beamformed measurements and nulling-only protected RF signals for all visible MGNSS satellites. Defining a physical and informational open standard for the Soteria interface is vital to employ advanced AJ/AS/SA capabilities in concert with the SDUE. It will promote competition based on performance and cost. In summary, the Government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical and physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols throughout the navigation architecture, addressing antenna subsystems and avionics architectures. Security Certified Software Defined Receiver and Standard Digital Interface The SDUE shall be a security certified, unclassified-when-keyed software defined SATNAV military receiver based on a field-programmable logic device technology (e.g., Field-Programmable Gate Array {FPGA}, Programmable Logic Device {PLD}, System on a Chip {SoC} FPGA). The design should be manufacturer-agnostic, shall implement the GPS security requirements set forth in GPU-PRD-711 and GPU-PRD-705, and comply with cyber requirements. The Government is projecting it can furnish an FPGA-based, security-certified architecture and associated intellectual property with Full/Government purpose data rights (as appropriate, and jointly agreed to) for the SDUE effort.? The security-certified architecture and intellectual property is currently being developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory under a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contract with The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) on a project known as ?Janus?.? This architecture is expected to be security-certified by Dec 2025, in accordance with GPU-PRD-705. ?NOTE: An interim process/certification report will be available by late Summer 2023. Respondents are under no obligation to use what may be provided from the Janus effort to develop and deliver the required capabilities.? Respondents can use other secure, feasible, and efficient alternatives of the FPGA or devise their own architecture, as long as the Government can obtain data rights for the implemented architecture. As part of an Emerging Capability Technology Development (ECTD) effort, MITRE and The Ohio State University Antenna Electronics (OSU) teams are collaborating on the development of a standard interface and an interface control document (ICD). This will allow interoperability between MGNSS receivers and MGNSS beamsteering antennas, in order to break vendor lock scenarios and enable the effective and efficient insertion of new and advanced capabilities. The Government plans to engage industry to discuss the draft standard interface design with vendors, and to consider vendor inputs and recommendations, with the goal of defining a universally acceptable open interface standard. Operational Context Soteria, SDUE, and the Resilient-Embedded GPS/Inertial Navigation System (R-EGI) are the three components that will collectively provide the Vanguard (first use) targeted capabilities necessary to deliver robust and resilient PNT to the warfighter. These three systems are envisioned to be nominally configured as shown in the attached document. The integrated capabilities of the proposed systems are shown as intended to support the effective and affordable operation of USAF, Joint/Coalition platforms, and weapon systems in evolving threat environments. It should be noted the three systems are expected to operate in a tightly coupled relationship, allowing aiding and the sharing of information to provide the desired resiliency and robustness while executing AS and SA functions. Hence, the Government is placing an emphasis on using non-proprietary open standard interfaces.

If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company or institution?s capabilities in meeting these requirements.? Failure to provide this documentation may prevent the Government from being able to assess your capabilities.? If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience or capabilities in order to perform that aspect of the requirement (i.e., through teaming or subcontracting). Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business applicants. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this market research.? Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged but not required. Other Transaction Authority (OTA) offerings, whether used as a contracting vehicle by a sole RFI responder or to RFI responders as part of a consortium, will be considered by the Government to achieve requirements.? RFI responders are requested to indicate any prior experience working under an OTA construct. RFI responders are requested to identify as a University Affiliated Research Center, if applicable. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to the Program Manager, as identified on the final page of this RFI. As stated in the ?Department of Defense Open Systems Architecture Contract Guidebook for Program Managers?, version 1.1 (Jun 2013), the five principles of OSA are: Modular designs based on standards, with loose coupling and high cohesion, that allow for independent acquisition of system components. Enterprise investment strategies, based on collaboration and trust, that maximize reuse of proven hardware system designs and ensure we spend the least to get the best. Transformation of the life cycle sustainment strategies for software intensive systems through proven technology insertion and software product upgrade techniques. Dramatically lower development risk through transparency of system designs, continuous design disclosure, and Government, academia, and industry peer reviews. Strategic use of data rights to ensure a level competitive playing field and access to alternative solutions and sources, across the life cycle. As alluded to in principle 1. above, the establishment of an open Soteria standard (software and hardware) will allow one or more qualified third parties to add, modify, replace, remove, or provide support for the antenna electronics or the LRU independently. ?Moreover, while an architecture incorporating any physical layer configuration will be considered, preferred proposed solutions will minimize Group A changes, to maintain the form and fit of current antennas and antenna electronics components and connecting cables.? To this end, it will be valuable for RFI responders to present existing interface control documents, and/or to demonstrate a capability to generate a best of breed SDUE and Soteria interface solution from existing solutions or concepts. Interested parties shall provide information that demonstrates the following: Section A: New requests to address (beyond the original RFI questions) The first spiral of Soteria and SDUE, to be called the Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), shall be based on the existing L1/L2 platform Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) capabilities (e.g., N79), and the use of L1/L2 GPS, L1/L2 QZSS, and Galileo E1 signals. Describe your approach and processes to satisfy the MVP requirements. Describe your approach and processes to upgrade the software and hardware (as needed) beyond the MVP requirements to allow capabilities that exploit the other MGNSS and Iridium signals existing in the band from 1160 MHz to 1627 MHz. NOTE: The Soteria SWAP is not to exceed the current ADAP SWAP.??The SDUE SWAP is not to exceed the current MGUE Inc.-I Aviation card SWAP. Given the existing SWAP and datalink limitations, describe the number of MGNSS signals to which your beamform can approach, and explain your plan to manage AJ for the remaining MGNSS signals. Describe your processes to maintain compatibility and synergy between Soteria and SDUE as new capabilities and updates are implemented in a manner to stay relevant in the evolving threat environment. It is expected that the insertion of Soteria, SDUE, and R-EGI into platforms will be staggered, for various technical and programmatic reasons. Describe your approach to enable modularity and interoperability among various combinations of CRPAs (existing and planned; for example, GSTAR, DIGAR, Soteria), GPS and MGNSS receiver modules (e.g., MGUE, SDUE), and/or PNT Line Replaceable Units (e.g., EGI-M, R-EGI).? All solutions should adhere to the principles of open systems architecture mentioned previously. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your preferred solution (which may use a teaming or prime/subcontractor plan)? Briefly describe your preferred approach and the elements involved (e.g., use of a Design Agent, prime contractor, or subcontractor) to execute the SDUE and Soteria acquisition program. NOTE: This question is optional. The Government is interested in the overall rapid prototyping cost. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for your proposed Development effort. Respondents are requested to provide a ROM estimate for the SDUE and Soteria rapid prototype phases, which can be provided as a range.

Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: ?Name and address of firm Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) Size of business Average annual revenue for past three years Number of employees Whether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a Number of years in business Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners If you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor? A list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on April 25, 2022. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice/RFI must be emailed to jsc-imoc3@mail.nasa.gov . An Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in sam.gov. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website and https://www.nasa.gov/jsc/procurement/imoc3 for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. IMOC III Description: It is anticipated that the IMOC III will be a Single-Award, 100% Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Cost-Plus-Award-Fee contract. It is also anticipated that there will be an option to transition to cost-plus-fixed-fee and/or firm-fixed-price task orders at the discretion of the Government. For your reference, the Draft IMOC III Statement of Work is attached to this posting. A summary of content for the proposed IMOC III contract includes, but is not limited to, the following: To provide support and products for spaceflight operations capability development and execution for the JSC FOD and the International Space Station Program (ISSP): Avionics and Software Office (OD). This includes support to mission preparation (Plan), crew, flight controller, instructor, and analyst training (Train), and real-time mission execution (Fly) activities related to exploration operations and the International Space Station operations.

IMOC III requirements may include, but are not limited to, services such as: Contract Management and Administration Operations Support for Vehicle / System / Program Design and Development Mission Preparation (Plan) including Technical Integration, Product Development, Mission Analysis, and Mission and Training Systems Support Mission Training (Train) Development, Planning, Documentation, and Execution Mission Execution (Fly) including Real-Time Mission Support and Postflight Analysis Astronaut Office and CAPCOM Support Avionics and Software Integration, Coordination, And Support Activities The pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: Current Contractor: KBR Wyle Services, LLC Contract Number: NNJ14RA01B Estimated Contract Value: Approximately $1.3 billion Contract Expiration Date: September 30, 2023 Capability Statement: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: Describe your company's overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the draft IMOC III SOW. Please identify specific draft IMOC III SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 1 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the page limitation. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. Company-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: ?Name and address of firm Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, phone, and email) Size of business Average annual revenue for past three years Number of employees Whether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a Number of years in business Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners If you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor? A list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were IDIQ, please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide optional comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics. Specifically, interested parties are requested to address the following items: What documents would you like to see on the IMOC III contract website or included in the Technical Library? If this contract is not set aside, how can NASA design/structure the contract to ensure that small business goals are met or exceeded? Considering the extension of ISS Operations through 2030, and other NASA programs and missions on the horizon, what are the potential advantages of a contract period of performance beyond 5 years? Are there any disadvantages? NASA invests significant time and resources into certifying qualified fight controllers and instructors across multiple programs. With the end of ISS planned to be 2030, the ongoing increase in career opportunities with other aerospace companies, and the long lead time in training flight controllers and instructors, NASA is concerned with recruiting and retaining the required personnel long enough to see a return on this significant training investment and meet the needs of all programs, which have varying flight frequencies and durations. How can the contract be structured to mitigate this issue? What are industry best practices, including any innovations or efficiencies and added value? What were the lessons learned from other industries or agencies? What innovations might you propose in the performance of this contract or contract structure? If the Government issues a Request for Proposal (RFP), the government reserves the right to restrict the procurement to small businesses. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI): In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the IMOC III acquisition. The nature of the work anticipated under the IMOC III contract may create the potential for OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA?s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for IMOC III. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under IMOC III will include the following types of tasks, which could lead to potential OCI issues: Partner directly with NASA vendors to provide select Plan, Train, Fly (PTF) services in support of NASA?s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) commercialization objectives. Provide operational assessments to NASA of NASA and vendor component and system designs, design requirements, analysis, and models developed for: Artemis (including Orion, Gateway, HLS, SLS) International Space Station (ISS) (including LEO commercialization objectives) Extravehicular Activities (EVA) Commercial crew and cargo providers New technology development Provide support to NASA for NASA and vendor design, development, and technical integration operations activities for programs and projects including: Generic analysis and trade studies Reference mission development Operations concepts development Spacecraft and payload safety compliance Risk management ?Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor PTF processes, standards, products, and training/certification requirements used for spaceflight mission operations planning, training, and execution activities for programs and projects. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback to the NASA certifying official, as part of the documented NASA certification process, on student (e.g., crew, flight controllers, instructors, analysts) and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities. Monitor, evaluate, and provide feedback on non-FOD student and training systems performance for certification and mission training activities (e.g., Engineering or Program personnel, International Partners, External/Commercial partners). Provide support to NASA for the development of NASA and/or vendor user requirements and user verification and acceptance testing for user applications, mission systems, training systems, and test facilities within the associated facilities that are developed and maintained by Contractors Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional information associated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitive procurements Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant?s proprietary information where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is not the IMOC III Contractor These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending on the composition of the team selected for the anticipated IMOC III contract: Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the IMOC III Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a government procurement contract Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and advice to NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASA?s preparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASA?s evaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement Potential impaired objectivity if the IMOC III contractor or its subcontractors are assessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractor A link to the NASA?s Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest is below: https://nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_organizational_conflicts_of_interest.pdf Please reference this document for additional information about NASA?s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the IMOC III contract? What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed IMOC III contract that were not identified in this RFI? Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the IMOC III that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential IMOC III RFP? If so, please explain. NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror?s proposed OCI mitigation strategy. NASA will respond to each company who submits an OCI mitigation strategy. NASA?s response will simply be an attempt to examine circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI and is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI issues have been identified, that an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI. NASA?s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for IMOC III in the future. Furthermore, NASA?s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interested party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for IMOC III. Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA?s response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. The Contractor will still be required to comply with the RFP OCI requirements and its submission will be considered in accordance with the RFP. The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only. NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the interested party who submitted it. Submission Instructions: Interested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than twenty pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on sam.gov and on the IMOC III website. Interested firms are responsible for monitoring this website for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice/RFI by 5:00 p.m. CST on April 25, 2022. All responses under this Sources Sought Notice/RFI must be emailed to jsc-imoc3@mail.nasa.gov . An Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

A competitive vendor has not been found that can provide these services for this highly critical infrastructure system. The Secure Payment System provides a mechanism by which Federal Program Agencies (FPA) can create and certify payment data in a secure fashion. SPS is the front-end system to a larger payment system.? SPS allows personnel at FPA locations to submit payment information to the Fiscal Service using an internet-accessible system. Payment schedules are streamed to the Fiscal Service?s payment system for processing. On an annual basis, the Fiscal Service generates over 950 million payments. SPS is considered Critical infrastructure (CI) ? a part of ?systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States, the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.?? If SPS is unavailable or compromised, economic stability could be impacted potentially affecting millions of citizens and the national economy. Based on NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 199, SPS is rated HIGH. This publication establishes security categories for information systems. The security categories are based on the potential impact on the Fiscal Service should certain events occur which jeopardize SPS to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, and maintain its day-to-day functions. For SPS, the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability will cause a severe degradation in or loss of Payment Management?s most critical mission. ?

Number: 47PF0022F0039 Region: 05 City: International Falls State: Minnesota Contracting Officer: Anna Vanko Phone Number: 513-505-6253 PROJECT: International Falls Land Port of Entry, International Falls, MN? PROJECT TYPE: New Construction - Land Port of Entry CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Projection SIZE: approximately 100,000 gsf to 150,000 gsf BUDGET: $154,000,000 to $164,000,000? FUNDING: Funds are currently available via Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented designers and artists to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.? In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and security requirements and the facility will include design in metric units.? PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project is a new land port of entry on the northern border in Minnesota. The proposed site is in International Falls, adjacent to an existing Land Port of Entry. This new project will be a gateway to our country and will transform an obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art commercial port of entry, which will improve safety and security for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It shall make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. The intended delivery method will be Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) which will include a firm-fixed price Design Phase and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Construction Phase Option. The Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the current tenant. The existing facility was constructed in 1993, and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.? Although the existing Land Port of Entry is not old, it was designed and constructed several years before the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the significant changes to the way business operations occur at the border. It is on an extremely constrained and congested site which is surrounded by an active paper mill operation, traversed by inbound and outbound road and rail traffic, and is? very close to the foot of the international bridge connecting International Falls and Fort Frances, Ontario. Consequently, the current facility is not adequate in size, efficiency, safety and security. The existing building cannot be expanded upon to meet the new requirements of the Federal Inspection Services on the existing site. SCOPE OF WORK The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, interior space planning, and related consulting services for the concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, development of a GSA Building Design Standard, Building Information Modeling (BIM), computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) administration, Information Technology (IT), Audio Visual (AV), security, and post-construction contract services (PCCS). The project is also to include GSA design standards; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements, including the Land Port of Entry Design Standard. GSA aims to minimize tenant disruption and maintain operation of the existing LPOE throughout construction through construction phasing. The project scope includes an expanded Program of Requirements, over a previous FY2011 study, of space and facilities for the Federal Inspection Services/Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Agriculture Plant Protection and Quarantine (USDA), and Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), to carry out their agency missions at the border. The current facility only houses CBP; USDA and FWS will be new tenants in the new LPOE. The improvements project includes design and construction of new buildings. Expanding the site will allow for enhanced traffic flow and management, and removing existing dangerous traffic conflicts between travelers entering and leaving the United States with railroad trains traversing the current site. POTENTIAL RISKS The project will be compliant with the Design Excellence Guiding Principles and GSA's Design Excellence Program will be implemented as part of the project. The project must occur while the existing port remains fully operational. In accordance with NHPA Section 106, consultation with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) must be conducted and an archeological survey must be completed. Unknown site and environmental issues will be investigated during the course of design and remediation plans developed, as appropriate.? Stormwater management on the constrained site will require use of Best Management Practices to comply with EISA Section 438. Sustainability requirements and goals beyond P-100 baselines, including LEED Gold and Site Silver, reduction in whole-building embodied carbon, operational Net Zero, Fossil Fuel Free, Water Net Zero, and Grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) resilience will require study and integration into the project to the maximum extent possible.

Project Description: Mill and resurface CR720 and Griffin Road. Once CR720 & Griffin Road are resurfaced, install pavement marking in accordance with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). CR720 and Griffin Road are in Glades County Florida. All work will be performed within the CR720 right of way. CR720 is bound by US 27 to the west and the Glades County line to the south. The Glades County line is approximately half a mile south of Shawnee Farms Road and is marked by an adjacent roadway sign. CR720 is approximately 9.2 miles long. The lands around CR720 are primarily agriculture with sparsely distributed single family residents throughout. CR720 meanders between agriculture land and single family homes. CR720 is composed of five ninety degree turns with straight section of pavement inbetween each curve. Each curve has guardrail on either side of roadway just off the edge of pavement. CR720 crosses two railroad tracks. For the majority of the road, roadside ditches exist on either side of road. There are above grade and below grade utilities that will need to be accounted for during construction. Utility impacts and drainage improvements are not anticipated.

For example, a potential conflict may arise if former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror may have gained access to nonpublic information about a competitor through participation in previous or ongoing performance or during the solicitation development/source selection process associated with this competitive procurement, and then participates in the formation of the Offeror?s proposal.? Other potential conflicts of interest may arise where either the former Department of Navy employee(s), subcontractors, or teaming partners of the Offeror under this competitive procurement set the ground rules for competition; for example, by drafting specifications or assisting in the drafting of the statement of work. General guidance may be found in FAR 3.101 and 9.505; however, this guidance is not all-inclusive.? (c)? If an Offeror identifies a potential conflict of interest that exists at any tier, that Offeror is requested to notify the Contracting Officer within 14 days of the date of this solicitation.? The Offeror shall provide:?(1)?the contract or previous source selection?s solicitation number and name and phone number of the Contracting Officer for the contract which gives rise to a potential conflict of interest; (2) a copy of the requirement; (3) the statement of work and technical instruction from the existing contract, as applicable; (4) a brief description of the type of work to be performed by each subcontractor under the competitive procurement; (5) a brief description of the individual?s, subcontractor?s, or teaming partner?s unequal access to nonpublic information about a competitor, which may lead to a conflict of interest in the formation of the Offeror?s proposal, or establishment of ground rules for this competitive procurement, as applicable; (6) an OCI mitigation plan, as applicable; and (7) any additional information the Contracting Officer should consider in making a determination of whether a conflict of interest exists.? The Government may independently verify the information received from the Offeror.? The requirement to identify potential conflicts of interest as outlined herein continues until contract award.? Notwithstanding the above, the Government reserves the right to determine whether a conflict of interest exists based on any information received from any source.? (d)? The Government will notify an Offeror of any conflict of interest within 14 days of receipt of all required information.?

ARTS-V1, CLPS, and AATS are for modern, long-range, strategic Surface to Air Missile (SAM) threats. The system will provide full fidelity simulation of the tracking and engagement component of the threat(s). ARTS-V1 and CLPS are a robust and ruggedized mobile system that tracks and/or engages multiple targets simultaneously. AATS is a similar system which is stationary, and placed in an environmentally controlled structure. Additionally, the system is representative of actual threats by replicating Effective Radiated Power (ERP), threat signals, antenna patterns, operational modes, and offensive and defensive tactics. These capabilities are incorporated into the range?s Digital Integrated Air Defense Systems (DIADS) in order to send training mission data to the Range Control Center (RCC) for processing and analysis. The ARTS-V1 and CLPS consists of a low-power section for waveform generation, coupled with a high-power Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter, and a PESA. Figure 1 below illustrates a rendering of the Operator Unit (OU), which houses the radar operators and backend of the system. Figure 2 below illustrates a rendering of the Operator Room for the AATS system. Figure 3 below is a rendering of the Radar Unit (RU), which consists of the high-power radar portions? ARTS-V1 and CLPS, including the radar antenna, associated power control, various radar transmit, receive, and control components, and the RU trailer.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires installations to be energy resilient and microgrids are being pursued to meet those energy resiliency goals. Energy resilience, as defined by DoD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, is defined as ?the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that impact mission assurance on military installations.? As defined by the Microgrid Exchange Group (MEG), ?A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.? A Microgrid, at a minimum, is a system of interconnected loads (such as, but not limited to, buildings or structures) and distributed energy resources (such as, but not limited to, generators, photovoltaics, wind farms, energy storage) which are physically separated and located throughout a complex or military installation which are to operate and function together as one entity to provide energy to mission essential loads when needed. The Microgrid is to provide power in a similar fashion to a utility providers electrical distribution system. It must also provide demand response and be able to disconnect from the utility provider?s electrical distribution system as needed to operate in an island mode. The Microgrid is to control the distributed energy resources, so they function together as a whole even though they are physically separated and originally intended to provide power to a single load for example. The Microgrid can provide power to an entire complex or installation, or to selected mission essential loads within the complex or installation. An electrical system with various energy resources which provides power to a single load is not considered a Microgrid. The work under this contract will primarily be in support of Military Installations, with occasional support of Civil Works, and the Work for Others Programs. Work will be within the continental United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii. Primary work under this contract will involve but not be limited to: inspection and condition assessment surveys of existing sites, verification of existing reference materials, verification of existing conditions, data collection of energy usage, assets, and infrastructure, consulting and coordinating with stakeholders to define priority missions and loads, risk identification and assessment, concept development, engineering and design, Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), cost estimating and life cycle cost analysis, system modeling and studies, technical specification preparation, testing, participation in the commissioning of, and report writing, all related to the design of microgrids. Secondary work will involve, but not be limited to, the design, construction, renovation and/or alteration to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities and repair and maintenance to institutional, industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational type facilities. Types of related work including but not limited to highway, other paved surfaces, utility systems, site work, and Energy Resiliency Conservation and Improvement Projects (ERCIP) may be a part of both the primary and secondary work. Both primary and secondary work shall include design and construction support to include the following professional disciplines: architects, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, and geotechnical engineers, interior designers, landscape architects, and specification writers. LEED Accredited Professional(s) are required in addition to Licensed Professional Engineers and Registered Architects. The following Tertiary work and Related work will only be performed as needed to complete the work related to Microgrids and ERCIP efforts. Tertiary work will include, but not be limited to, preparation of concept, preliminary, and detailed designs for the removal, remediation, abatement and restoration of environmental hazards including soil and groundwater, lead paint, asbestos, PCB's, and other contaminated wastes. Professional qualifications for the third level of work shall include but not be limited to: environmental engineers/environmental scientists, certified industrial hygienists, geologists, and hydrologists/hydraulic engineers. Related work will include historical preservation, economic and life cycle cost analysis, planning, site investigations, design analysis, claims analysis, schedule preparation, surveying, studies, reports, and expert witness efforts.

The plan should describe the AE?s proposed work management approach for executing the work to be performed under this contract including team composition, roles and responsibilities of key team members and each subcontracted firm and its approach for ensuring high quality work products performed by the firm and their subcontractors.? The plan shall include information on quality control processes and procedures, cost and schedule control, coordination of in-house disciplines and consultants, and relevant experience working with each of the subcontractors on similar projects.? Section C, Section D, Section G and Section H of the SF 330 will be used to evaluate this criterion.? In reviewing the above project management and teaming information, the evaluation board will consider how the firms, including joint ventures (JV) and Offerors utilizing of affiliates, subsidiaries, parent, LLC, LTD member companies, propose to execute the scopes of work (Section 2 Project Information).? Organization of the firm?s team will be evaluated in accordance with Section 4 Submission Requirements (e.g., JV, Mentor-Prot?g?, etc.). d. Past Performance. ?The firm shall possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, and ability to manage subcontractors.? Assessment against this criterion will be determined primarily by evaluating ratings performed in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), the Government-wide evaluation reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts, or via those provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs).? In reviewing past performance information, the evaluation board will consider the relevancy of the past performed work in addition to how well the firm performed.? Positive references from customers and other verifiable information as to exemplary performance may also be considered as provided in Section H of the SF330.? With their SF330, the firm shall provide the CPARS report or PPQ for each of the projects identified in Section F of the SF330.? The firm shall provide the full contract number and task order number (if applicable) for any Federal contract listed in Section F of the SF330.?

Do not submit a PPQ when a completed CPARS is available.? If a project is not a federal project or a CPARS report is not available, the firm shall complete Part I of the PPQ, send it to the customers, request that they complete Part II of the PPQ and return to the firm, and submit it with the SF330 submission.? No sealed envelope is required.? A blank PPQ can be found attached to this synopsis (Attachment B). The evaluation board may seek and consider past performance information from other sources but is not required to do so if none is available from CPARS or if no PPQ is provided.? Other sources of information the evaluation board may consider include interviews with organizations and Government personnel familiar with the firm?s performance.? If little to no relevant past performance data (CPARS reports, PPQs, or information in Section H) is available, the firm may be given a neutral evaluation regarding past performance.? CPARS reports or PPQs shall be placed at the end of Part I of the SF330 (they will not be counted towards the page count). e. Capacity. ?The firm must demonstrate the capacity for successfully executing multiple task orders concurrently while maintaining quality and schedule.? A firm shall be evaluated on the available capacity of key personnel from the prime firm and its teaming consultants primarily through a review of each firm?s Part II submission and any information provided in SF330 Section H as to their methods for managing workload.? The prime contractor needs to demonstrate that they have the core competencies to perform work required under the contract on their own merit.? In order to meet or exceed the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, ""Limitations on Subcontracting (Sept 2021)"", the prime contractor along with ?similarly situated? subcontractors must have the capacity to perform at least 51% of the work over the life of the contract.? ?Similarly situated? subcontractor means a first-tier subcontractor, including an independent contractor that has the same small business program status as that which qualified the prime contractor for the award and that is considered small for the specified NAICS code (example - if prime is a WOSB, then subcontractors that are WOSB would count towards the goal).? The firm should address how it will meet these requirements based upon the assumption that the items listed under ?Specialized Experience and Technical Competence? above constitute the preponderance of the work to be performed under this contract. f. Knowledge of Locality. ?Work under these contracts may be in a widely dispersed geographic area, therefore responding firms should demonstrate the extent of their capabilities to serve federal installations throughout CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii. The board will evaluate a firm's knowledge and experience with working on military installations and other federal complexes across the country. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, F, and H of the SF 330.? g. ?Extent of Participation of Small Businesses (SB) concerns.? Firms shall identify their small business team members and indicate their commitment to utilize SBs to include Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB).? Extent of use will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the small business concern is a prime contractor, sub-contractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation the greater the consideration. ?(Applies only to Large firms). h. Volume of DoD Contract Awards.? Firms shall indicate in Section H of the SF330 the volume of DoD AE contracts awarded to the prime (or JV) in the last 12 months. This information will be verified and updated during the interviews with the most highly qualified firms.

This will allow for an expedited procurement process for the customer and the acquisition force. Background The Abiomed Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist catheter is a disposable component of an Impella driver/controller system currently utilized at the VA Healthcare System. This Item is required/specific for high risk Cardiac/Coronary interventions. These are used in critically ill patients during acute coronary intervention to support the ventricular function of the heart and helping reduce cardiogenic shock. Item Specifications: The Catheter is a sterile tubular device with a built in electrically powered axial flow pump. The distal end designed to provide circulatory assistance to the heart by pumping blood during heart failure. It is inserted through the lumen of the aorta and into the left ventricle, surgically or percutaneously via an artery. Then connected to an external control unit that moves blood from the left ventricle to the aorta across the aortic valve. The Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist heart pump delivers full cardiac support, allowing the heart to rest and enabling the heart to achieve its natural pumping function without additional support. The heart pump is designed for long-duration support, enabling patient mobility, and optimizing recovery by using real-time intelligence. Used during cardiogenic shock, the Impella 5.5 will support the heart s pumping function, providing blood and oxygen to vital organs. This Catheter is typically used emergently post-acute myocardial infarction, electively for high-risk cardiac catheterizations for open chest surgery. This component is used in conjunction with the Impella device and has a clear indication for Cardiogenic Shock and is used as an assist device in such cases to stabilize the patient for transfer to a critical care facility. This catheter must be compatible with the Abiomed Automated Impella Controller. The Automated Impella Controller is the primary user control interface for the Impella platform featuring a 10-inch high-resolution display. It controls the Impella catheter performance, monitors for alarms, and displays real-time hemodynamic and catheter position information.

[CONTINUE TO NEXT PAGE] PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION: The Government is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet qualification requirements to repair the aircraft parts listed near the top of this RFI. This requirement is for repair services. The government?s repair services strategy is a five-year contract (basic plus four ordering periods) and will continue through FY27. The projected quantities will be Best Estimated Quantities (BEQ) based on historical repair activity on previous repair contracts and operational usage data. The Government?s needs for these repair services are required in order to support the training mission of the USAF TH-1H helicopter. This aircraft is a refurbished Bell UH-1H helicopter with an installed Huey II kit, which includes a more powerful engine, new dynamic components, a new nose and tail boom. The cockpit and mission equipment upgrades include a digital cockpit, and crashworthy seats. These modifications transformed a legacy aircraft into a state-of-the-art training platform compatible with future operational aircraft. The TH-1H's advanced electronics provide expanded training opportunities and improved operational capabilities by upgrading the engine, transmission, and rotor system. It has multi-function displays allowing for future upgrades and provides new aircrews with a seamless transition from the TH-1H to a follow-on rotary wing aircraft such as the HH-60G Pave Hawk, CV-22, and future Combat Search and Rescue-X helicopters. These aircraft parts are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items.? The manufacturer of the items listed is Northrop Grumman LITEF GMBH in Germany (Cage D4856). The following narrative will give a basic description of these aircraft instruments at the center of this requirement. Both parts are different models (older and newer) of the Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS), which is an all-attitude inertial sensor system which provides aircraft attitude, heading, and flight dynamics (body rates and accelerations) information, which are typically used for flight control and pilot displays.? The system is mechanized as a strap-down inertial measurement system using fiber optic rate sensors and micro-mechanic accelerometers which are ?strapped down? to the principle aircraft axes.? A digital computer mathematically integrates the rate and acceleration data to obtain heading and pitch/roll attitude.? Augmented by air data, the system also provides filtered inertial altitude and vertical velocity. As stated previously, these components have been designated with the Repair Method Code (RMC)/Repair Method Suffix Code (RMSC) listed below: RMC R3:?? Repair, for the second or subsequent time, directly from the actual manufacturer. RMSC Z:?? This part is commercial non-developmental off-the-shelf item.? Commercial item descriptions, commercial vendor catalog or price lists or commercial manuals assigned a technical manual number apply. CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY: Part I.

Number: 47PF0022F0039 Region: 05 City: International Falls State: Minnesota Contracting Officer: Anna Vanko Phone Number: 513-505-6253 PROJECT: International Falls Land Port of Entry, International Falls, MN? PROJECT TYPE: New Construction - Land Port of Entry CLIENT AGENCY: Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Projection SIZE: approximately 100,000 gsf to 150,000 gsf BUDGET: $154,000,000 to $164,000,000? FUNDING: Funds are currently available via Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation?s most talented designers and artists to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.? In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and security requirements and the facility will include design in metric units.? PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project is a new land port of entry on the northern border in Minnesota. The proposed site is in International Falls, adjacent to an existing Land Port of Entry. This new project will be a gateway to our country and will transform an obsolete border facility into a state-of-the-art commercial port of entry, which will improve safety and security for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It shall make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the welcoming of visitors and citizens to the United States of America. The intended delivery method will be Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) which will include a firm-fixed price Design Phase and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Construction Phase Option. The Department of Homeland Security - Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the current tenant. The existing facility was constructed in 1993, and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.? Although the existing Land Port of Entry is not old, it was designed and constructed several years before the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the significant changes to the way business operations occur at the border. It is on an extremely constrained and congested site which is surrounded by an active paper mill operation, traversed by inbound and outbound road and rail traffic, and is? very close to the foot of the international bridge connecting International Falls and Fort Frances, Ontario. Consequently, the current facility is not adequate in size, efficiency, safety and security. The existing building cannot be expanded upon to meet the new requirements of the Federal Inspection Services on the existing site. SCOPE OF WORK The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, traffic engineering, interior design, interior space planning, and related consulting services for the concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, development of a GSA Building Design Standard, Building Information Modeling (BIM), computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) administration, Information Technology (IT), Audio Visual (AV), security, and post-construction contract services (PCCS). The project is also to include GSA design standards; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements, including the Land Port of Entry Design Standard. GSA aims to minimize tenant disruption and maintain operation of the existing LPOE throughout construction through construction phasing. The project scope includes an expanded Program of Requirements, over a previous FY2011 study, of space and facilities for the Federal Inspection Services/Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Department of Agriculture Plant Protection and Quarantine (USDA), and Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), to carry out their agency missions at the border. The current facility only houses CBP; USDA and FWS will be new tenants in the new LPOE. The improvements project includes design and construction of new buildings. Expanding the site will allow for enhanced traffic flow and management, and removing existing dangerous traffic conflicts between travelers entering and leaving the United States with railroad trains traversing the current site. POTENTIAL RISKS The project will be compliant with the Design Excellence Guiding Principles and GSA's Design Excellence Program will be implemented as part of the project. The project must occur while the existing port remains fully operational. In accordance with NHPA Section 106, consultation with the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) must be conducted and an archeological survey must be completed. Unknown site and environmental issues will be investigated during the course of design and remediation plans developed, as appropriate.? Stormwater management on the constrained site will require use of Best Management Practices to comply with EISA Section 438. Sustainability requirements and goals beyond P-100 baselines, including LEED Gold and Site Silver, reduction in whole-building embodied carbon, operational Net Zero, Fossil Fuel Free, Water Net Zero, and Grid-interactive efficient building (GEB) resilience will require study and integration into the project to the maximum extent possible.

The Department of Defense (DoD) requires installations to be energy resilient and microgrids are being pursued to meet those energy resiliency goals. Energy resilience, as defined by DoD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, is defined as ?the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that impact mission assurance on military installations.? As defined by the Microgrid Exchange Group (MEG), ?A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island-mode.? A Microgrid, at a minimum, is a system of interconnected loads (such as, but not limited to, buildings or structures) and distributed energy resources (such as, but not limited to, generators, photovoltaics, wind farms, energy storage) which are physically separated and located throughout a complex or military installation which are to operate and function together as one entity to provide energy to mission essential loads when needed. The Microgrid is to provide power in a similar fashion to a utility providers electrical distribution system. It must also provide demand response and be able to disconnect from the utility provider?s electrical distribution system as needed to operate in an island mode. The Microgrid is to control the distributed energy resources, so they function together as a whole even though they are physically separated and originally intended to provide power to a single load for example. The Microgrid can provide power to an entire complex or installation, or to selected mission essential loads within the complex or installation. An electrical system with various energy resources which provides power to a single load is not considered a Microgrid.

The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying, and subsequently maintaining, a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer for the items described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees. Purchase of one (1) brand name or equal MSD ELISA Instrument (reader), MESO QuickPlex SQ 12 for the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Office of Tissue and Advanced Therapies (OTAT), Division of Plasma Protein Therapeutics (DPPT), Hemostasis Branch (HB). Part of this market research effort is to determine that only this name brand instrument can meet CBER?s requirement. Alternative solutions will be considered insofar as any such alternate system and/or system components meet the minimum brand name or equal technical requirements. Background The CBER/OTAT/DPPT/HB regulates Plasma Protein Therapeutics intended to treat patients with abnormal hemostasis in particular, deficiencies in blood coagulation, and performs research in this area. The laboratory studies biochemistry of blood coagulation involving factor VIII (FVIII) which deficiency results in life-threating bleeding known as Hemophilia A. In particular, the study of (i) structure and functions of FVIII related to plasma clearance of FVIII that is relevant to FDA review and generation of longer-acting FVIII products, and product-related impurity in therapeutic FVIII products relevant to increasing purity of FVIII products. Altogether, these directions are related to generation of more efficient and safer FVIII products to improve treatment of Hemophilia A. Purchase of MSD ELISA Instrument or equal will allow detection and quantitation of FVIII and its experimental variants with extremely high sensitivity and selectivity (specificity) in a wide dynamic range in various complex matrixes, containing numerous interfering compounds, such as cell culture media and both human and model animals (mice etc.) plasma, as the system uses a unique proprietary electrochemiluminescence protein detection. The MSD ELISA Instrument or equal required for the project is needed to measure very low concentrations of FVIII in both cell culture upon protein expression and animal plasma in FVIII pharmacokinetics studies, as no other methodology, including common types of ELISA applications, can measure protein content at such conditions with required sensitivity. Also, the methodology allows measuring concentrations of other proteins related to different research projects, and study aims. Minimum Performance Requirements Sensitivity: At least 10-100 pg of protein antigen/mL in particular assays Specificity: The assay must be based on Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle Dynamic Range: Wide linearity such as that in the range of 104-105 concentration units Plate read time (based on ECL principle): Not more than 2 min Size: Compact, not more than 14 x 25 x 22 (in).

Data from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) may be also utilized by the Government. 2. Superior Performance Evaluations on recently completed DoD contracts. Performance with ratings of exceptional will be considered as Superior Performance Evaluations. 3. The extent to which potential contractors identify and commit to small business and to small disadvantaged business (SDB) where the NAICS Industry Subsector of the subcontracted effort is one in which use of an evaluation factor or sub-factor for participation of SDB concerns is authorized (see FAR 19.201(b)), and to historically black college or university and minority institution performance as subcontractors. The extent of commitment shall comply with the requirements of FAR 52.219-8. Offerors demonstrating a greater commitment to small business participation will be evaluated more favorably under this criterion. ?? 4. Geographic Proximity within the locations for Alaska: Firms based in or having branch offices in AK with core disciplines (full-service) including architects, and mechanical, civil, electrical, and structural engineers working in the same office or within a proximity of fewer than 50 miles from the state will be considered as meeting the requirement for geographical proximity. CRITERIA RATINGS: Technical criteria described above (A, B, C, E, and F) will be assigned one of the following adjectival ratings: BLUE (Outstanding) SF 330 Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements and contains multiple strengths, and the risk of unsuccessful performance is low ? ????????? PURPLE (Good) SF 330 Proposal indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements and contains at least one strength, and the risk of unsuccessful performance is low to moderate. ? ????????? GREEN (Acceptable) SF 330 Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements, and the risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. ? ????????? YELLOW (Marginal) SF330 Proposal has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements and/or risk of unsuccessful performance is high. ? ????????? RED (Unacceptable) ? ????????? SF330 Proposal does not meet the requirements of the synopsis advertised on Contracting Opportunities, and thus contains one or more unacceptable deficiencies, and/or risk of unsuccessful performance. The proposal is non-awardable. The following adjectival relevance and performance confidence ratings will be used to evaluate the Past Performance criteria (D): Relevance Ratings Very Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Performance Confidence Ratings Substantial Confidence - Based on the offeror?s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Confidence - Based on the offeror?s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral - No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror?s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. The offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance. Limited Confidence - Based on the offeror?s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No Confidence - Based on the offeror?s recent/relevant performance record, the Government does not expect that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. ENFORCEABILITY OF PROPOSAL: The proposal must set forth full, accurate, and complete information as required by this announcement. By submission of the offer, the offeror agrees that all items proposed (if applicable e.g., key personnel, subcontractors, etc.) will be utilized for the duration of the contract and any substitutions shall require prior Contracting Officer's approval. The award decision for this contract will be based, in part, on an evaluation of the key personnel and/or subcontractors the offeror included in its proposal for the positions and/or items of subcontracted work identified in the proposal. The offeror agrees these key personnel and/or subcontractors will be employed as described in its proposal and no substitutes will be employed without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer or Administrative Contracting Officer. The offeror further agrees that any proposed substitutes shall meet or exceed the qualifications of the original personnel and/or subcontractors. If the offeror?s proposal did not name a subcontractor for an identified item of work, the contractor will not be allowed to subcontract that item of work without prior approval of the Contracting Officer or Administrative Contracting Officer. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Indicate in Section C.11 if the prime has worked with the team members in the past six (6) years.?

The General Services Administration has a requirement for Construction Contract for Tenant Improvements and Modernization in the Historic Federal Building in Anchorage, Alaska.? The Anchorage Federal Building, informally known as the ""Historic?Federal Building"" (HFB, AK0001AN),?is a circa 1930?s reinforced concrete building, with 3 floors,?a basement,?a flat roof,?and a parapet. The building was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, noted architect of National Parks lodges and many federal buildings in the western United States. It is built in the style characterized as ""New Deal Concrete,"" constructed of cast-in-place concrete with steel reinforcement,?featuring?tall, vertical windows. The building survived Anchorage's 9.2 magnitude earthquake of 1964 and the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in 2018, thanks to its robust construction and low profile. The HFB?is located in the center of Anchorage?s Central Business District (CBD) and was completed in 1939. ?It originally housed a post office, a courthouse, and other miscellaneous federal agencies. The building was expanded in 1941, almost immediately after the original building completion in 1939, to house additional agencies, and in 1958, the building was expanded again to house a Territorial Courtroom. The final addition occurred in 1991, when a warehouse was constructed for NARA in what was formerly the?open courtyard space. The NARA warehouse was then converted in 2019 into a parking garage, and it is attached to the building via an enclosed walkway. The Anchorage Historic Federal Building is currently listed on the Secretary of Interiors historical register and therefore all work will be in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior standards for the treatment of historic properties, requirements of the Anchorage Courthouse/FOB preservation plan and U.S. General Services Administration?s technical guidelines and contract documents.

The construction contractor must consider the GSA?s historic preservation plan for the building and potential impacts to historic character defining features. Construction must avoid impacts that diminish the historic integrity of character defining features.? Construction must avoid compromising of facilities structural integrity.? The facility will remain fully occupied during construction. Competition:? Set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns.??
