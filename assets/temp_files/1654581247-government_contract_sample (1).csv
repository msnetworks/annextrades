Sunshade Lighting Solution 23d Contracting Squadron, Moody AFB, GA 31699 Solicitation Number: FA483022SC001 Date: 22 December 2021 SECTION A: Introduction The 23d Contracting Squadron (23 CONS) is conducting a Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) authorized by Department of Defense Class Deviation 2018?O00016. Under a CSO, the Air Force may competitively award proposals received in response to a general solicitation, similar to a broad agency announcement, to acquire innovative commercial items, technologies, and services based on a review of proposals by scientific, technological, or other subject?matter experts within the Air Force. Under this CSO, all items, technologies, and services shall be treated as commercial items. The Air Force intends to obtain ?innovative? solutions or potential new capabilities that fulfil requirements, close capability gaps, or provide potential technology advancements. Solutions may include existing technologies or procedures that are not currently in use by units on or supported by Air Combat Command (ACC) bases, that would enhance or streamline their mission capabilities. ?Innovative? is defined as any new technology, process or method that is new as of the date of submission of a proposal. It may include an application of an existing technology, method, or process that is not currently in use by ACC or its supported units. This CSO contains a broadly defined Area of Interest (AOI). While this AOI is geared toward meeting requirements at locations listed therein, the Government reserves the right to award contracts from this CSO to meet Air Force requirements at other locations with similar AOIs and mission requirements. Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals as soon as practicable after reviewing this document. 23 CONS may utilize one of the following processes for evaluation and award: A single?step CSO evaluation process which consists of offerors whose proposed solutions clearly meet the Government?s needs expressed in the AOI receiving an immediate notice that they have been selected for award or selected to provide more information that may subsequently lead to an award; or A two?step process where offerors are invited to make a virtual pitch of their proposal to an evaluation panel which will then select the proposal(s) that best meet the Government?s desire for solutions in its stated AOI. Pitches will be conducted virtually and are anticipated the day following after receipt of proposals. ?The offeror will provide its 30-minute pitch via teleconference or videoconference, followed by no more than 30 minutes for Government deliberation. Barring any additional concerns or clarifications, the Government?s intent is to execute an immediate purchase order upon completion of deliberations for acceptable offers.? SECTION B: Instructions for Preparation and Submission of Proposals All contracts will be firm?fixed price. All supplies or services obtained via this CSO are considered commercial items. Because all awards made under this CSO are considered commercial, 23 CONS intends to award FAR part 12 contracts but reserves the right to award other agreements (e.g. Other Transactional Agreements (OTAs)), if deemed in its best interest.

The members of the CSO team will do their best to post answers to questions received in response to this CSO as they are obtained, but may consolidate answers to a regularly scheduled post to avoid many answers being posted in a single day or to limit the need for many separate amendments. CSO Provision-Subject to Availability of Funds Funds are not presently available for this CSO.? The Government?s obligation under this CSO is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for CSO purposes can be made.? No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. Further funding discussions will be contained the AOI. Notifications of Award and Protests Unsuccessful offerors shall receive notification of award and small business status of awardees.? Protests may be filed in accordance with FAR Part 33, DFARS Part 233, and AFFARS Part 5333.? Protests of small business size or status to the SBA may be filed pursuant to 13 CFR Part 121 and FAR Part 19. SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO.

SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO.

SECTION C: Procedures and Criteria for Selection Proposals As stated above, 23 CONS may use either a one or two-step process for evaluation of proposals for award. After receipt of step 1 proposals, 23 CONS will conduct an evaluation based on three factors: Technical merit of the proposed solution to adequately address the need Level of risk in the proposed solution/milestone schedule and its ability to meet the need within a relevant time period Funds availability - price will be considered, and must be fair and reasonable The evaluation process will proceed as follows: Technical Evaluation of the White Paper. The non-price portions of the proposal will be reviewed holistically to make an assessment of the validity of the proposed solution and the offeror?s capability to support the proposed solution. Risk Assessment: The non-price portions of the proposal will be similarly reviewed to assess the solution's potential to enhance the mission effectiveness of the unit within a timely manner. Funds Availability: The offeror?s pricing information will be evaluated to determine to what extent funding is available for the solution.? Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. 23 CONS must determine the price fair and reasonable prior to award using the procedures at DFARS subpart 212.209. The contracting officer will use market research as the primary method to determine the price fair and reasonable. In rare circumstances, the contracting officer may request other than certified cost and pricing data from the offeror regarding recent purchase prices paid by the government and/or commercial customers for the same or similar commercial items. At the conclusion of Step 1 and based on the results of the evaluations, 23 CONS will select offerors for immediate award or to participate in Step 2. All offerors will be notified as to the status of their proposals at this time. Offerors that are selected for Step 2 will receive an invitation to pitch to the 23 CONS team, at a proposed date/time (TBD). The evaluation criteria for step 2 is the same as step 1. During any step of the CSO, 23 CONS may request additional information from offerors that will need to be answered by email or during a Pitch Day presentation. 23 CONS reserves the right to cancel a pitch and immediately make awards or not make a specific award or any awards if it deemed in its best interest. Pitches shall not contain classified data or sensitive information and proprietary information shall be clearly marked. If a cleared contractor wishes to make a classified or sensitive pitch, those will be handled on a case by case basis. SECTION D: Area of Interest See Attachment 1 for the AOI related for this CSO. SECTION E:? Definitions ""Other Transaction? refers to the type of Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) that may be placed as a result of this CSO.? This type of OT is authorized by 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b for prototype projects directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or for the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.? This type of OTA is treated by DoD as an acquisition instrument, commonly referred to as an ""other transaction"" for a prototype project or a Section 2371b ""other transaction"". ?Prototype Project? is defined in the DoD Other Transactions Guide (Version 1, Nov. 2018) issued by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment: https://www.dau.edu/guidebooks/Shared%20Documents/Other%20Transactions%20(OT)%20Guide.pdf. Such project can generally be described as a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing.? A process, including a business process, may also be the subject of a prototype project. Although assistance terms are generally not appropriate in OT agreements in 10 U.S.C. ? 2371b, ancillary work efforts that are necessary for completion of the prototype project, such as test site training or limited logistics support, may be included in prototype projects.? A prototype may be physical, virtual, or conceptual in nature.? The quantity of prototypes/commercial solutions should generally be limited to that needed to prove technical or manufacturing feasibility or evaluate military utility. ??Small Business Concerns? is defined in the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and 13 CFR Part 121. ?Innovative? is defined, consistent with Section 879 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2017, Public Law 114-328, and Class Deviation ?

The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days of the expiration of this contract. Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. This includes options under FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which applies to this solicitation. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). NOTE: The specified rates under this clause will be those rates in effect under the contract each time an option is exercised under this clause. (End of Clause) C.3 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 5 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 7 days before the contract expires.

The nonmanufacturer rule and the limitations on subcontracting apply to all SDVOSB and VOSB set-asides and sole source contracts. (2) Service-disabled Veteran means a Veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(2), with a disability that is service-connected, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16). (b) General. (1) Offers are solicited only from eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. Only VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns (SDVOSBs) may submit offers in response to this solicitation. Offers received from concerns that are not VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns shall not be considered. (2) Any award resulting from this solicitation shall be made to a VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern that meets the size standard for the applicable NAICS code. (c) Representation. By submitting an offer, the prospective contractor represents that it is an eligible SDVOSB as defined in this clause, 38 CFR part 74, and VAAR subpart 819.70. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(e), only VIP-listed SDVOSBs are considered eligible. Therefore, any reference in 13 CFR part 121 and 125 to a service disabled veteran-owned small business concern (SDVO SBC), is to be construed to apply to a VA verified and VIP-listed SDVOSB and only such concern(s) qualify as similarly situated. The offeror must also be eligible at the time of award. (d) Agreement. Agreement. When awarded a contract (see FAR 2.101, Definitions), including orders under multiple-award contracts, or a subcontract, an SDVOSB agrees that in the performance of the contract, the SDVOSB shall comply with requirements in VAAR subpart 819.70 and SBA regulations on small business size and government contracting programs at 13 CFR part 121 and 125, including the nonmanufacturer rule and limitations on subcontracting requirements in 13 CFR part 121.406 and 125.6, provided that for purposes of the limitations on subcontracting, only VIP-listed SDVOSBs shall be considered eligible and/or similarly situated (i.e., a firm that has the same small business program status as the prime contractor). An independent contractor shall be considered a subcontractor. An otherwise eligible firm further agrees to the following: (1) Services. In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (2) Supplies or products. (i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs.

(3) General construction. In the case of a contract for general construction, it will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (4) Special trade contractors. In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, it will not pay more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not VIP-listed SDVOSBs. (5) Subcontracting. Any work that a VIP-listed SDVOSB subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the percent of subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. For supply or construction contracts, cost of materials is excluded and not considered to be subcontracted. For mixed contracts and additional limitations, refer to 13 CFR 125.6. (e) Joint ventures. A joint venture may be considered an SDVOSB if the joint venture is listed in VIP and complies with the requirements in 13 CFR 125.18(b), provided that any reference therein to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern or SDVO SBC, is to be construed to mean a VIP-listed SDVOSB. A joint venture agrees that, in the performance of the contract, the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (d) of this clause will be performed by the aggregate of the joint venture participants. (f) Precedence. For any inconsistencies between the requirements of the SBA program for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns and the VA Veterans First Contracting Program, as defined in VAAR subpart 819.70 and this clause, the VA Veterans First Contracting Program requirements have precedence.

This is not a formal Request for Quote (RFQ) or proposal (RFP).? Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.? United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has the need to increase the ceiling value of our current Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, H92401-18-D-0006, for Tactical Radio Application eXtension (TRAX) support with Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) 444 Salomon Circle, Sparks, NV 89434. TRAX capabilities are an integral part of the Digitally Aided Close Air Support Gateway SOF (DACAS-G-S) system fielded across the USSOCOM communications spectrum.? This contract supports maintenance, integration, training, aircraft demonstrations, exercise support for fielded systems, and Field Service Representative (FSR) support.? Moreover, this support includes software assurance for existing Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) on TRAX v2.0, TRAX Application Program Interface (API), Android TRAX (ATRAX), TRAX Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) Plug-in, and future TRAX software improvements/upgrades and the TRAX software meets Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certification requirements.? USSOCOM has procured enterprise licensing from SNC allowing proliferation of the capability throughout USSOCOM.? The above contract is currently set to expire on 23 August 2023 and, due to the higher than anticipated proliferation of the TRAX capability throughout the USSOCOM Special Operation community, the current contract ceiling value is not adequate to ensure continued support. In the last two ordering years, there has been a growth rate of 72% in obligation under the contract, with $16.4M being obligated last ordering year.? Due to fluidity of the requirements and changes in operational demands, it is estimated that the Special Operations community will require a similar obligation rate this year as last year, at $13.6M, and that this rate will increase again over the next ordering year to meet mission needs.? Therefore, it is necessary to increase the current contract ceiling by $16.7M. The modification will be executed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one source is capable of satisfying the agency's requirements. ?This determination is based on the fact that SNC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and sole developer of TRAX/ATRAX software and given the fact that the Government did not purchase unlimited rights, no other company can provide the appropriate software updates/upgrades and level of support to sustain existing TRAX/ATRAX software systems. Per FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit additional capability statements that will be considered by the agency. Any party responding to this notice shall send clear, factual documentation demonstrating their ability to execute this requirement. NOTE: Given that this contract is not set to expire until late FY23, SOCOM currently has no plans to purchase an alternate capability at this time, but rather to continue to sustain TRAX/ATRAX. Therefore, capability statements must demonstrate the ability to either a. provide this sustainment in lieu of SNC, or b. provide an alternate capability that not only meets all the key capabilities of the SNC TRAX/ATRAX software and is Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) certified, but also offers increased capabilities that outweigh the substantial duplication of cost to the Government and significant delays in fulfilling our mission requirements that would be associated with introducing this new capability at this time. All replies must be provided to the Government no later than Tuesday, June 6th 2022, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. ?All inquiries and responses concerning this action shall be sent in writing via email to both: jennifer.s.pruente.civ@socom.mil and charlotte.k.montoya.civ@socom.mil.
