In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government. Offerors are advised that award will be made to that Offeror whose quote provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining technical and performance capability superiority rather 8 of 10 than lowest overall price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall price to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as quotes become more equal based on other factors. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ.

Offerors should be aware that the Government shall perform a ?best value analysis? and the selection for award shall be made to the Offeror whose quote is most advantageous to the Government. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award to that Offeror whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government. MINIMUM ACCEPTANCE PERIOD ?Acceptance period,? as used in this provision, means the number of calendar days available to the Government for awarding a contract from the date specified in this solicitation for receipt of proposals.

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
