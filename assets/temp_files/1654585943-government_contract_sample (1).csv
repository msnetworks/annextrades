The work is to upgrade and expand treatment capacity at the Roemer WFF by 7.2 MGD. This expansion in capacity is also necessary to allow the District to utilize additional SWP water and relax pumping of their groundwater wells. This operation shift will allow groundwater levels to recover and ensure that the District can continue to provide water to meet its customers needs. The District is planning to expand the Roemer WFF from the current 14.4 MGD to 21.6 MGD to treat additional SWP water.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Design, Manufacture, and Performance - Except as modified herein, the VALVE,CHECK furnished under this contract/purchase order shall meet the design, manufacture, and performance requirements specified on drawing ;80064 803-1385637; cage ;80064 803-1385637-062AF(MOD); . 3.1.1 ;(MOD) - A 1/8 inch diameter hole to be drilled in the Disc, PC 17 of Drawing 803-1385637, to provide priming flow to the standby service pump.; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Configuration Control - MIL-STD-973 entitled ""Configuration Management"", Paragraph 5.4.8, Configuration Control (Short Form Procedure), is hereby incorporated. The Contractor shall submit all Engineering Change Proposals in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.2 and Appendix D. Requests for Deviations shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.3 and Appendix E. Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.3.1 Configuration Control - When the Contractor has received authorization on a prior contract for the same NSN for the use of a drawing of a later revision status, that authorization is hereby extended to all succeeding contracts/purchase orders until another drawing revision is approved. The Contractor will notify the PCO of this occurrence in each instance, in the response to the solicitation. Such notification shall be in writing setting forth the contract under which the prior authorization was granted, the date of the granting of the authorization, and the name of the granting authority. Contractors shall also refer technical inquiries (other than those covered by MIL-STD-973) on company letterhead signed by a responsible company official, with copies distributed as stated below. The original and two copies of all Contractor generated correspondence regarding configuration shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P.O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0788. Contractors are cautioned that implementing engineering changes, waivers, deviations or technical inquiries into the contract/purchase order without approval of the Contracting Officer will be at the sole risk of the Contractor. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government.

For a test duration of more than 24 hours, the tolerance must be + 60 minutes/- 0 minutes. 3.5 Ball Spherical Surface Finish - Spherical surfaces of valve balls must be finished as follows: Machine finish spherical surfaces of the valve ball to between 30 and 35 RHR; use lubricant. Grind, hone, or cup polish to 16 RHR maximum; use lubricant (light oil or soap solution). Grit blast with glass bead media (MIL-PRF-9954-MIL 10); use a 3/16 inch ID blasting nozzle (not supersonic type) 4 inches from ball at 75 PSI air pressure. The resulting surface finish should be less than 25 RHR.Perform final polish with SUPFINA Polishing Paste (Pink polishing paste, item code 10100244, Supfina Machine Company, North Kingstown, RI). Apply the SUPFINAPolishing Paste that is initially light pink in color over the entire surface of the ball with a brush and perform a low speed finishing process with both theball and a .250"" thick wool pad (Style 22110, Aetna Felt Corporation, Allentown, PA^) turning at the same time with light pressure for approximately 30 seconds^^ (3 revolutions) of the entire surface of the ball. Once the light pink SUPFINA polishing paste that was applied to the surface of the ball turns a grey color, the final finishing process is complete. After the final finishingprocess is complete, the surface of the ball should have a matte dull appearance with a surface finish between RHR 12 and RHR 16. Clean ball with a warm, alkaline solution or a liquid nonionic detergent to remove SUPFINA polishing paste. ^ Reference customer number PLI00499 when ordering wool pad. ^^ CAUTION: Excessive time will cause the ball to be polished in violation of the process."" 3.6 Wedge Tensile Test Specimens (Headed fasteners) - A wedge tensile test must be conducted on a Full Size Fastener for each production lot and reported aspart of the Mechanical Properties.

Grind, hone, or cup polish to 16 RHR maximum; use lubricant (light oil or soap solution). Grit blast with glass bead media (MIL-PRF-9954-MIL 10); use a 3/16 inch ID blasting nozzle (not supersonic type) 4 inches from ball at 75 PSI air pressure. The resulting surface finish should be less than 25 RHR.Perform final polish with SUPFINA Polishing Paste (Pink polishing paste, item code 10100244, Supfina Machine Company, North Kingstown, RI). Apply the SUPFINAPolishing Paste that is initially light pink in color over the entire surface of the ball with a brush and perform a low speed finishing process with both theball and a .250"" thick wool pad (Style 22110, Aetna Felt Corporation, Allentown, PA^) turning at the same time with light pressure for approximately 30 seconds^^ (3 revolutions) of the entire surface of the ball. Once the light pink SUPFINA polishing paste that was applied to the surface of the ball turns a grey color, the final finishing process is complete. After the final finishingprocess is complete, the surface of the ball should have a matte dull appearance with a surface finish between RHR 12 and RHR 16. Clean ball with a warm, alkaline solution or a liquid nonionic detergent to remove SUPFINA polishing paste. ^ Reference customer number PLI00499 when ordering wool pad. ^^ CAUTION: Excessive time will cause the ball to be polished in violation of the process."" 3.6 Wedge Tensile Test Specimens (Headed fasteners) - A wedge tensile test must be conducted on a Full Size Fastener for each production lot and reported aspart of the Mechanical Properties. The required specimens for the Wedge Tensile Test must be separate fasteners from those required for the Yield Test. 3.6.1 Testing for Socket Head Cap Screws must be in accordance MIL-DTL-1222, paragraphs 4.5.2.3 and 4.5.2.3.1. 3.6.2 Testing for all other Headed Fasteners with a nominal diameter greater than 1/4-inch must be in accordance with ASTM-F606 for grades 5, 8, B7, and B16.For all other grades, the following wedge angles must be used. a.

Except as specified in item c below, fasteners with a nominal diameter over 1-inch must be tested with a six degree wedge. c. Fasteners that are of grades 8, B7, B16, 410, 416, 416Se, 431, and 630 and are threaded within one diameter to the underside of the head must be tested as follows: Sizes 1/4 inch through 3/4 inch (inclusive) Use a six degree wedgeSizes over 3/4 inch Use a four degree wedge d. Fasteners which have passed testing with wedge angles greater than those specified should be considered acceptable. 3.6.3 For fasteners having a length less than the minimum specified in Table 1 of ASTM-F606, one ""test specimen fastener"" must be manufactured from each lot of fasteners and tested to represent that lot. The length of these test specimen fasteners must meet the minimum specified in table 1 of ASTM-F606 but must not exceed it by more than 1/4 inch. Test specimen fasteners must be the same type, style, and diameter as the production lot and must be manufactured from the same starting material, using the same manufacturing techniques as the production lot, and must be heat treated (if required) along with the production lot. 3.7 Contract Support Library - Additional requirements for this item are identified as Contract Support Library Reference Number ;CSD200 and CSD205; in ECDS at https://register.nslc.navy.mil/ 3.8 Thrust Washer Material - Thrust washer, ;piece 8 on NAVSEA drawing 803-4385051; to be Nylatron GSVQ-II (Nylon 66 with molybdenum disulfide) in accordance with MIL-DTL-32286, as manufactured by Quadrant Engineering Plastic Products (EPP). 3.9 A visual inspection shall be performed on the finished seat with acceptance criteria on critical surfaces per CSD167 in the ECDS (Electronic Contractor Data Submission) system at: https://register.nslc.navy.mil/. 3.10 K-MONEL Fasteners - Material must be heat treated per QQ-N-286. 3.10.1 Fasteners that have been hot or cold headed or roll threaded must be solution annealed followed by age hardening subsequent to all heading and thread rolling operations. The mechanical properties on certifications must be actual properties of the annealed and age hardened material and must meet the requirements of QQ-N-286. 3.10.2 QQ-N-286 fasteners that have been headed and/or roll threaded must not beage hardened unless the material has been solution annealed subsequent to the heading and threading operations. Threads formed after the final age hardening heat treatment must be cut or ground only. 3.11 K-MONEL Fasteners - K-MONEL externally threaded fasteners must have mechanical properties determined in accordance with MIL-DTL-1222. Test results must include Tensile, Yield, Elongation and Hardness as required by MIL-DTL-1222. (The Hardness tests must be performed on a full size fastener.) 3.11.1 Studs require an Axial Tensile test in accordance with MIL-DTL-1222. 3.11.2 Headed fasteners require a Wedge Tensile test as specified elsewhere in this contract/purchase order. 3.12 Seat Stack Height Measurement - To ensure that each seat is within tolerance, check each seat singularly by measuring the seat height over the ball. This measurement is calculated by adding one-half ball diameter to the half stack height dimension on the drawing. Limits are determined by the ball diameter tolerance and the half stack height tolerance. Check dimensions by measuring from the seat back face to top of ball. Manufacturers of seats that do not have a ball of the required size available will be required to manufacture a dummy ball or segment of a ball with sufficient spherical surface to check the above dimension. 3.13 Internal Threads - All internal threads must be formed by cutting. Cold forming of internal threads is not acceptable. 3.14 Thread Inspection Requirements - All threads on threaded parts must be inspected using appropriate inspection methods, inspection systems, and inspection gages/instruments in accordance with FED-STD-H28 series. Substitution of thecommercial equivalent inspection in accordance with ASME B1 series is acceptable. 3.14.1 System 21 of FED-STD-H28/20 must be used as a minimum inspection requirement for threads when the design drawing or design specification does not specify an inspection requireme..."
