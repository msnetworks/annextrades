Requests for Waivers shall be processed in accordance with MIL-STD-973, Paragraph 5.4.8.4 and Appendix E. (Original and two copies shall be submitted to Contracting Officer, NAVICP-MECH, P. O. Box 2020, Mechanicsburg Pa. 17055-0788.) 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (76 degrees F +/- 10 degrees F). Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchause order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection reqiurements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed reqiurements. 4.2 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 4.4 Quality System Requirements - The supplier shall provide and maintain a quality system acceptable to the Government. The quality system requirements shall be in accordance with ISO 9001. 5.

Opportunity:?? ? Idaho National Laboratory (INL), managed and operated by Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC (BEA), is offering the opportunity to enter into a license and/or collaborative research agreement to commercialize this new technology for the treatment of wastewaters.[TEL3]? This technology transfer opportunity is part of a dedicated effort to convert government-funded research into job opportunities, businesses and ultimately an improved way of life for the American people. Overview:?????? ?? In its annual 2019 report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts an 85% increase in energy related water usage in the upcoming years. Considering this, it is imperative that versatile, cost-effective, and energy efficient water technologies are developed. Wastewater reclamation is one step in a multi-stage solution to solve the looming freshwater availability crisis. Wastewater reclamation is environmentally and fiscally relevant because it can yield purified effluent and recover valuable products. ?Proven water remediation technologies such as reverse osmosis, multiple effect distillation and multistage flash distillation can require significant direct energy input. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging technology that has shown promise. ? Description:?? ??CDI is an electrochemical technology used to absorb ions using electric potential applied between two electrodes. Conventional CDI employs fixed electrodes which upon full saturation must be discharged into a strip solution. Thus a cell must go through absorption/strip cycles and also likely a rinse step after stripping to remove residues. Flow Electrode capacitive deionization (FE-CDI) employs microscopic particles (both anode and cathode) which are flowed through the cell. [TEL4]?A separate strip cell can simultaneously discharge the ions to a concentrate stream for recovery. The advance described here involves dramatically increased absorption capacity of the particles to enhance performance over existing FE-CDI systems. An example of a FE-CDI system is shown in Figure 1. Here an ammonia (ammonium ion is prevalent at neutral pH) stream flows into the top cell and ions report to anode and cathode flowing electrodes (X- represents the variety of anions present in water). After absorbing ions, the slurry flows to the strip cell operated at the opposite polarity and ions are released into solution. Key components to the cells are a pair of ion-specific membranes (anion and cation specific) which effectively keep the solutions from mixing with the electrode slurry yet allows ions to pass. Benefits:?????????? Increased system capacity using novel solid absorption particle[RMB5]? Larger capacity reduces footprint/increases throughput Continuous operation avoids strips cycles Reduced cross-contamination and rinsing operations Opportunities for new electrode designs and configurations Applications:? Municipal waste water treatment ? reducing ammonia discharge Water treatment for various industrial contaminates prior to discharge Treatment of legacy wastewater [RMB6]? Cleanup of mining effluents Recovery of diluted value chemicals Development Status:? TRL 3. Critical function experimentations and proof-of-concept. IP Status: ???????? US Patent Application No. 17/110,487,? Methods of Removing Contaminants from a Solution, and Related Systems,? BEA Docket No. BA-1132 INL is seeking to license the above intellectual property to a company with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Exclusive rights in defined fields of use may be available. Added value is placed on relationships with small businesses, start-up companies, and general entrepreneurship opportunities.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals or quotes, and therefore, will not accept, review, or evaluate unsolicited proposals or quotes received in response hereto. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or, reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI. The information provided may be used by VA in developing its acquisition strategy and Product Description or Performance Work Statement (PWS). Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary; however, any information received shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the respondent.

This is a request for information and does not obligate the Government in any way, nor does it commit the Government to any specific course of action. Forms and Publications (FP) Orders is a legacy mainframe application hosted at a VA datacenter. This application is used enterprise-wide by approximately 500 end users to requisition items for their locations, including: paper forms, publications, Veteran burial flags, and gun locks (in support of the VA's Suicide Prevention program). FP Orders contains over one thousand orderable items. The Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics (OPAL) Service Distribution Center (SDC) uses the application to process and track the requisition requests and uses various system reports to conduct inventory management functions to ensure adequate stock is on hand to fulfill all requests. Due to the age and complexity of the application, it is difficult to support and maintain. VA is interested in replacing this legacy mainframe application with a modern solution compliant with VA policy and capable of meeting the needs of end users and the OPAL order fulfillment organization. 2.0 System Requirements The following system requirements are deemed mandatory unless otherwise noted: 2.1 Requisition Management: The system shall: Provide end users the ability to browse, search, and select items to requisition. Allow requisitioners to modify requisitions before items are shipped. Provide notification to requisitioner when an order status changes.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Quote (RFQ) and no submissions will be accepted as official offers for a contract. The BIE will not reimburse respondents for any expenses associated with this RFI. Background The Native American School Information System (NASIS) is a centralized system supporting teachers, other school staff, students, parents, and Central Office staff. NASIS provides the statistical reports necessary to fund various education programs, provides reports required by Federal and State education agencies, and provides the source data to analyze student performance along with the tools needed to perform the analysis. BIE is different from many other education jurisdictions in that BIE as the state education agency (SEA) is comprised of 183 schools in 23 states. The statutory and regulatory requirements are performed in NASIS by Central Office staff using NASIS reporting and analysis services. NASIS was deployed during the school year 2006-07 and is fully implemented SEA-wide. Prospective Requirement The BIE will be recompeting its current NASIS to a more dynamic and updated student information system. To better understand the latest student information system marketplace, the BIE is requesting pre-solicitation information as part of our research. Areas of specific interest are as follows: ? Database software designed and produced exclusively school/student applications ? Current existence and usage by other school systems ? Ability to migrate data from existing databases, and timelines for migration ? Flexibility to customize software post-installation ? Required maintenance and upgrades throughout the life of the software ? Sources of supply for both system and ongoing maintenance support ? Hosting on FedRamp, StateRamp, and/or commercial cloud hosting ? Ability to dynamically redistribute school information based on changes in district environment ? Ability to provide families online registration ? Provide listing of all API integrations with other platforms (LMS, curriculum) ? Ability to conduct mass email and messaging at school, district, and state levels ? Ability to service Pre-K, K-12, and Post-secondary institutions ? Ability to create reports in the required file specifications for submissions In addition, respondents are encouraged to provide any additional information that may be helpful in assisting BIE in its market research. Statement of Limitations 1. BIE represents that this RFI, submissions from respondents to this RFI, and any relationship between BIE and respondents arising from or connected or related to this RFI, are subject to the specific limitations and representations expressed below, as well as the terms contained elsewhere in this RFI. By responding to this RFI, respondents are deemed to accept and agree to this Statement of Limitations. Respondents to this RFI acknowledge and accept BIE?s rights as set forth in the RFI, including this Statement of Limitations. 2. BIE reserves the right, in its sole discretion, without liability, to utilize any or all of the RFI responses in its planning efforts. BIE reserves the right to retain and utilize all the materials, information, ideas, and suggestions submitted in response to this RFI. 3. This RFI shall not be construed in any manner to implement any of the actions contemplated herein, nor to serve as the basis for any claim whatsoever for reimbursement of costs for efforts expended in preparing a response to the RFI. 4. The submission of an RFI response is not required to participate in any potential future development process. 5. To the best of BIE?s knowledge, the information provided herein is accurate. 6. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by BIE to form a binding contract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.? The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.? Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.? Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.? Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. ?In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.? The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.? The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).? Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum.? After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed."

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii)??????? The solicitation number is 75N95022Q00282 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13?Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5? Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12?Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. (iii)?????? The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number 2022-06, with effective date 05/26/2022. (iv)?????? The associated NAICS code is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 1000 employees. This requirement is set-aside to small business. (v)??????? The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation?s leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people?s health and save lives. NCATS is one of 27 Institutes and Centers at the NIH and its mission is to catalyze the generation of innovative methods and technologies that will enhance the development, testing and implementation of diagnostics and therapeutics across a wide range of human diseases and conditions. The NCATS DPI plans, conducts and uses both internal and contract resources to advance collaborative research projects across the preclinical phases of the translational science spectrum. The NCATS DPI IFX enables data-driven decisions that accelerate translation by developing new or enhancing the application of existing methods that prioritize targets and therapeutic opportunities for evaluation; designing novel, fit-for-purpose chemical probes; and assessing the productivity of the translational research process. The NCATS DPI Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC) maintains a state-of-the-art laboratory whose mission is to support translational research throughout NCATS by providing analytical chemistry services involving the isolation, purification, identification and analysis of various therapeutic modalities for targeted disease states. Untargeted metabolomic profiling captures a detailed view of the chemical processes underlying cells and is the closest representation of a given phenotype (compared to other omics). Untargeted metabolomics thus plays a key role in translational research, from the identification of biomarkers to an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms that underlie diseases, and to the identification of targetable pathways or molecules. Importantly, untargeted approaches pinpoint specific pathways or reactions that can be monitored through high-throughput targeted assays. An ultimate goal is to automate the process of generating, analyzing, and interpreting untargeted metabolic profiles to accelerate research efforts. The acquisition of a ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QTOF) system dedicated to untargeted metabolomics would expand mass spectrometry capabilities within DPI providing significant benefit by enabling NCATS to meet the support demands of both internal and external collaborators. Current mass spectrometry instrumentation in the NCATS DPI ACC is primarily configured for routine targeted MS-based studies. By having access to a UPLC-MS dedicated to untargeted omics experimentation, NCATS will be able to fulfill unmet research needs. Multiple applications of this requested instrumentation at NCATS would include 1) identifying biomarkers of toxicity, treatment response, and diseases; 2) elucidating biological mechanisms underlying cellular differentiation, disease development, and treatment response; 3) narrowing down possible compounds to evaluate in assays based on metabolism features. This instrument would be part of a broader NCATS effort, that includes ACC, Early Translation Branch (ETB), Therapeutic Development Branch (TDB), Chemical Genomics Branch (CGB), and Information Technology Resources Branch (ITRB), to leverage metabolomics and other omics in preclinical and clinical research. It is worth noting that untargeted and targeted MS-based methods dovetail together to enable meaningful discoveries and facilitate comprehensive analysis throughout the progression of projects. The Agilent 6546 QTOF LC-MS system (Brand-name or equal) will be located the ACC laboratory where its operation and management can be overseen by mass spectrometry staff. Thus, without acquisition of the Agilent 6546 QTOF LC-MS system (Brand-name or equal), the NCATS IFX and ACC groups will be unable to expand the metabolomic, and multi-omic capabilities of NCATS. (vi)?????? The Informatics (IFX) Core Group, within the Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) seeks to purchase an Agilent 6546 QTOF LC-MS System with accessories (Brand-name or equal) in order to expand mass spectrometry capabilities and fulfill unmet research needs. For reference purposes, the Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (QTOF) with Tandem Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) that meet the need of this requirement is the Agilent 6546 Quadrupole Time-of-Flight MS Instrument with 1290 Infinity II LC, as per the specific requirement and salient characteristics provided in the attached PURCHASE DESCRIPTION (PD). (vii)????? The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed-price purchase order for this acquisition, and the anticipated delivery date is required within three (3) weeks after receipt of order (ARO). Delivery will be f.o.b. destination. The place of delivery and acceptance will be National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850.

REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS/INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS

Exclusive Soft Drink Pouring and Vending Rights Agreement ISSUE DATE: June 1, 2022

OPENING DATE: July 20, 2022

Introduction: The Bismarck Event Center (hereafter referred to as the “Event Center”) is issuing this Request For Proposals (RFP) to obtain written responses from interested parties for exclusive soft drink pouring and vending rights at the Event Center. For the purposes of this RFP, the “Event Center Facilities” refers to the Event Center Arena, the Exhibit Hall and the Belle Mehus Auditorium.

Project Description: The Event Center is seeking an exclusive beverage contract with a nationally recognized beverage company to create a partnership. This partnership includes exclusive soft drink pouring and vending rights as well as on-premises advertising opportunities.

Objectives: The Event Center intends to support its programs and goals through the pouring rights royalties, vending commissions and advertising opportunities provided to the Event Center for the period of the contract. In addition, the Event Center’s goal is to improve beverage services and sales by maximizing the availability of product and by developing and offering marketing and sales opportunities that benefit the Event Center and the beverage provider.

It is anticipated that an exclusive, long-term agreement for beverages will provide additional resources to support the Event Center’s operational and capital needs and in return the Event Center offers a business opportunity that can be beneficial to the selected vendor.

Beverages Covered: For the purposes of this RFP, ""Beverages"" means all carbonated and noncarbonated, frozen and unfrozen, natural or artificially-flavored nonalcoholic (less than 3% alcohol content) beverages for independent consumption and for use as mixers with alcoholic beverages and otherwise, including, but not limited to: nonalcoholic beverages with nutritive or nonnutritive sweeteners; packaged waters; natural or artificially flavored nonalcoholic fruit juices; fruit juice- containing drinks; fruit-flavored drinks (sweetened or unsweetened); 100% fruit juices, fruit punches and ades; hypertonic, hypotonic and isotonic energy and fluid replacement drinks (sometimes referred to as ""sports drinks""); packaged waters; bottled tea and coffee drinks and all drink or beverage bases, whether in the form of syrups, powders, crystals, concentrates or otherwise, from which any of the foregoing drinks and/or beverages are made.

Beverages do not include milk, flavored milk, milk-based products, brewed coffee, brewed tea, hot chocolate, fresh lemonade or any other beverage not expressly included in the definition of Beverages in this RFP. In addition, this does not include events with taste testings at trade shows or community events where we allow for free samples of the vendor’s product.

Exclusivity: “Exclusive” means the right to designate and supply the brand of Beverages to be served, sold, vended, dispensed or otherwise made available in the Bismarck Event Center Facilities for all events and all vending location. No other competitive products will be sold, dispensed or served at the Event Center Facilities including events served by caterers licensed by the Event Center except as agreed by the parties. In addition, this does not include events with taste testings at trade shows or community events where we allow for free samples of the vendor’s product.

No permanent advertising, signage, or trademark visibility for any competitive product will be authorized for display anywhere within the Event Center Facilities without the prior written approval from the Event Center Director and the selected vendor except for events with taste testings at trade shows or community events where we allow for the vendor’s booth signage to be displayed.

Responses to this RFP: Sealed proposals in response to this RFP, one (1) marked “ORIGINAL” and four (4) marked “COPIES, will be received at the office of the City Administrator, City of Bismarck, 221 North 5th Street, P.O. Box 5503, Bismarck, ND 58506-5503 until 3PM, July 20, 2022. Proposals arriving after that time will not be accepted. Each original shall be signed and dated by an official authorized to bind the proposer. Unsigned proposals will not be considered.

Proposals submitted via facsimile (FAX) machine, telephone, or electronic means, including but not limited to e-mail, in response to this RFP will not be accepted.

All proposals are subject to the provisions of this RFP/Instructions to Bidders and any amendments or additional information issued by the Event Center.

Site Visit: Proposers are invited to inspect the Event Center Facilities prior to submitting a response to determine all needs associated with the scope of work. Failure to inspect adequately shall not relieve a proposer from the necessity of furnishing and installing, without additional cost to the Event Center, any materials and equipment or performing any labor that may be required to carry out the intent of an agreement resulting from this RFP.

A Site Visit may be scheduled by contacting Charlie Jeske, Event Center Director at 701-355-1372 or by email at cjeske@bismarcknd.gov.

Questions: Submit all questions regarding this RFP in writing to Charlie Jeske at cjeske@bismarcknd.gov no later than Monday, July 18, 2022 at 12:00 noon. Please enter “Question for Beverage RFP as the subject line for an email.

Responses to all questions will be communicated to all persons who have supplied contact information to the Event Center. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

Reference to Other Data: Only information which is received in response to this RFP will be evaluated. Reference to information previously submitted or submitted outside the response shall not be evaluated.

Cost for Proposal Preparation: Any costs incurred by proposers in preparing or submitting offers are the proposer’s sole responsibility; the Event Center or the City of Bismarck will not reimburse any bidder for any costs incurred prior to award.

Time for Acceptance: Each proposal shall state that it is a firm offer, which may be accepted within a period of 120 consecutive days from receipt by the Event Center. Although the contract is expected to be awarded prior to that time, the 120 consecutive day period is requested to allow for unforeseen delays.

Confidentiality of Proposals: In submitting its proposal, the bidder understands that, after all of the proposals have been open and read, the proposals or parts of the proposals not excepted by the North Dakota Open Records Law may be subject to disclosure upon request.

Right to Submitted Material: All responses, inquiries, or correspondence relating to or in reference to the RFP, and all other reports, charts, displays, schedules, exhibits, and other documentation submitted by the bidders shall become the property of the Event Center when received.

Proprietary Information: The Event Center recognizes that in responding to this RFP, the proposer may desire to provide proprietary information in order to clarify and enhance their response. To the extent permitted by law, the Event Center will keep confidential such information provided that:

The information submitted is arguably proprietary, and 

The proprietary information is submitted in a separate book or section, and the separate book or section is clearly identified as containing proprietary information.

The reference to the proprietary information must be clearly made in the detailed response, and conversely the section in the proprietary information book shall be clearly labeled as to what in the detailed response it references.

Proposers should note that the City of Bismarck is a municipality, and as such its files are available for public review pursuant to the North Dakota Open Records Law. Proposers are cautioned to label as “proprietary” only that information which can be clearly demonstrated as being proprietary and not in common usage or common knowledge. Labeling as proprietary a complete proposal or information which is general in nature may be cause for rejection of a response.

Oral Presentations: All proposers should be prepared to present an oral presentation if requested by the Event Center prior to the award of the agreement. The oral presentation may be needed to supplement a proposal, if required, and shall be for proposal clarification purposes only.

Scope of Required Products and Services: The Event Center is seeking proposals from nationally recognized beverage companies to exclusively provide and sell specific beverages and/or soft drinks at the Event Center Facilities. The Event Center wishes to continue high levels of sponsorship and commission revenues through up-to-date equipment, efficient beverage marketing, sales and distribution, and competitive pricing and commissions as elements of an exclusive, long-term agreement. The successful proposer will apply its collective resources to continue to increase and improve the sale, service and availability of beverages at events at the Event Center Facilities.

The contractor shall provide the labor and parts required for equipment repair at no charge to the Event Center.

The Event Center will provide such heat, water, electricity, and ventilation as are necessary and reasonable to operate the equipment and devices provided.

 All losses of equipment supplied as a part of an agreement incurred by the contractor for whatever cause, including but not limited to fire, accident, theft or vandals, shall be the sole responsibility of the contractor.

In the proposal, the contractor should describe any contractor sponsored recycling programs available to the Event Center.

The proposal should describe the contractor’s program for repair service. At a minimum, the contractor should provide on call, as needed, vending and auxiliary equipment maintenance and repair service twelve (12) hours each day, seven days per week with a minimum response time of three hours.

AIRPORT CONCESSION DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (ACDBE) PARTICIPATION:

    Stated ACDBE Participation Goal: Authority desires to promote and foster a favorable climate within its organization and the surrounding community that will provide maximum opportunities for ACDBEs to participate in contracts, programs and related business activities of Authority. For this RFP, Authority has established a stated goal of Ten Point Twenty Three Percent (10.23%) for the utilization of ACDBEs by the Concessionaire in its performance of the completed Agreement throughout the Term.

For purposes of evaluating the ACDBE component of the proposals for Satellite Concession Services, the attainment of the ACDBE participation goal shall be measured as a ratio (percentage) of the gross receipts and expenditures of concessions with ACDBE interests to the total gross receipts and expenditures of all concessions under this contract. All ACDBE participants identified in a Proposal must have been previously certified as ACDBEs by the Authority or the Tennessee Unified Certification Program prior to the submission of such Proposal.

    Determination of ACDBE Participation. Authority does not desire ACDBE participation solely for the purpose of meeting established goals. Rather, ACDBE participants must actively engage in the performance of the completed Agreement. An ACDBE participant is required to perform a commercially useful function by being independently responsible for the execution of distinct work or obligations and carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing and supervising such work or obligations. In light of industry practices and other relevant considerations, an ACDBE participant must have a necessary and useful role in the transaction of a kind for which there is a market outside the context of the ACDBE program and must be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies utilized or provided by such ACDBE participant, for ordering, and negotiating and paying the price for, such materials or supplies, determining quality and quantity and installing them (where applicable). See Exhibit “B”, Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Requirements for additional details.
    No Discrimination. Authority hereby reaffirms that Authority shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, gender or handicap in the performance of any contracts for goods, services or in the conduct of business undertaken by Authority. Authority’s obligation is evidenced and administered by an affirmative action plan to identify and provide analysis of any problem areas in an effort to achieve full compliance with 49 C.F.R. Part 23. ACDBEs will be afforded full opportunity to submit Proposals in response to this RFP and must not be discriminated against on the grounds of race, color, national origin, age, gender or handicap in consideration for the award of the concession. Any questions pertaining to ACDBE certification procedures, eligibility criteria and submittal of affidavits and obtaining appropriate forms must be directed in writing to:

RIGHT TO REJECT ANY AND ALL PROPOSALS.  MNAA proposes to award the Contract to the lowest responsive and responsible Proposer, provided it has met the goals for ACDBE participation or, if failing to meet the goals, has made an acceptable good faith effort to meet the established goals for the ACDBE participation.  Proposer is advised that MNAA reserves the right to reject any and all Proposals submitted, to waive any and all informalities, irregularities and/or technicalities in any Proposal or Proposal Guaranty, to accept any Proposal deemed advantageous to it and to negotiate changes, deletions, or additions to these Contract Documents with the successful Proposer."

All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.beta.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer ? System for Award Management, which indicates ?All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).? Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.beta.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.beta.SAM.gov. Refer to www.beta.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg. Please begin the registration process immediately to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected. ALERT: You must submit a?notarized letter?appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration. Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter. However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation, or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM. Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).

This Plain Language Training (PLT) will help the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), within the Agency of Natural Resources (ANR), staff learn about plain language and how to incorporate it into permit applications, issued permits, and other informational and educational materials. Plain language is communication people can understand the first time they read or hear it. By using plain language, DEC staff can get our message across quickly, make sure more people understand our message, and save time explaining our message. In addition, staff can ensure applications, permits, and outreach materials are more accessible and easily translated into other languages. The purpose of this RFP is to collect proposals for Plain Language Training and instruction for DEC staff to make permitting and communications more transparent, clear, and user friendly.

STATEMENT OF DUTIES POSITION DESCRIPTION BACKGROUND USAID?s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.? Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.? OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.? OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation. To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office?s programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as ?bullpenners,? providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers? compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation. OTI?s DEIA Vision Statement: OTI is a collaborative environment that represents the global community at all levels of our organization. Uniting diverse backgrounds and experiences, we value individual expertise to advance peace and democracy around the world.? Values and associated behaviors that will enable this vision are:? ?Trust Model open communication, active listening and candor. Believe others when they share their experiences. Respect A respectful attitude should be shown to everyone. Allow for others to express complete opinion/thoughts without interruption, while recognizing that there are other perspectives and lived experiences. ?Belonging (Accessibility) Serve as an ally to those who feel excluded (professionally, socially, personally, etc.). Promote togetherness and acceptance through equitable behavior. Empathy Listen to understand, create space to be real/feel. Remind yourself to be conscious of how others may feel or receive your words Self-awareness/accountability Supervisors hold their peers to account on their expectations and behaviors. Seek regular, constructive feedback to understand how your words and actions affect and influence others, and how they are being perceived and interpreted. Acknowledge unconscious bias and be willing to learn and change behavior when confronted/corrected. For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:? https://www.usaid.gov/stabilization-and-transitions INTRODUCTION The Senior Transition Advisor is a member of USAID?s Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (CPS)/OTI Field Programs Division (FPD), and is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas with strong program management, budgetary and operational skills.

Notice This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only. 1.1 The purpose of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist and to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541620, which has a corresponding size standard of $16.5M. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Hubzone, and Women-Owned small business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice and if applicable, identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements and delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. 2. Description Objective: The Government is seeking a Contractor for consultation and construction oversight of Utah Reclamation Mitigation and Conservation Commission (Commission) aquatic ecosystem conservation, enhancement, and restoration projects and lands. Background: The Commission is responsible for mitigating the impacts to fish and wildlife and their ecosystems that resulted from construction and operation of the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project. As part of its mitigation program, the Commission has need for services to assist in evaluating, planning, designing, and overseeing construction of projects to restore, conserve, develop, or enhance aquatic ecosystems e.g. streams, rivers, floodplains, riparian areas, wetlands, and/or connected uplands. In addition to designing and overseeing construction of new projects, the Commission also has need for consultation services to monitor, maintain, modify, and make management recommendations for existing Commission aquatic ecosystem lands, projects, and associated facilities. This effort will result in an IDIQ Contract and is intended to be utilized on a Task Order (project) basis to accomplish specific projects in specific locations. The size and complexity of any given project will vary. For example, river segments to be restored/modified may vary in size from a few dozen to 5,000 feet or more in length, and the number of stakeholders and agencies involved in any given project may vary from less than three to more than a dozen. Project location could be in any part of Utah, but anticipated focus areas include the Provo River, Hobble Creek, Utah Lake, Diamond Fork, Strawberry River, Duchesne River, Great Salt Lake, and Jordan River watersheds. Project-specific locations, task requirements and scope will be specified per individual Task Order. Contractor duties will include a blend of indoor and outdoor work. Construction/implementation of projects - i.e. constructing or modifying aquatic ecosystem project features using heavy equipment and/or manual labor - will be carried out by crews employed separately by the Commission or its partners. The Contractor for this effort will have no role in selecting construction crews. Revegetation implementation - i.e., site preparation, seeding, planting, mulching using heavy equipment and/or manual labor - will primarily be carried out by crews or vendors arranged separately by the Commission or its partners. The Contractor for this effort will have no role in selecting revegetation implementation crews. This effort includes, but is not limited to: -Field Assessment, Evaluation, and Monitoring: Collect field data on aquatic ecosystem conditions and may include wetlands, hydrology, geomorphology, topography, sediment, soil, vegetation, threatened/endangered/sensitive species, nesting birds, aquatic habitat, water quality, or other aquatic ecosystem resources. -Data Analysis and Modeling: Review, analyze and/or model aquatic ecosystem resource data to assess temporal or spatial patterns, describe existing conditions and ecosystem linkages, predict future conditions, inform project designs, meet permitting requirements, or inform land management decisions. -Project Planning and Design: Prepare plans and designs for aquatic ecosystem conservation, enhancement, and restoration projects that meet Commission goals, which includes integrating plans/designs with existing landscape/project features; incorporating results of data collection, modeling, and Commission and stakeholder input into plans and designs; prepare maps and drawings to illustrate design; prepare revegetation plans, construction schedule, and estimated quantities and costs; and support permit applications. -Construction Oversight: Oversee construction crews to ensure that construction outcome meets design intent and achieves project goals, which includes coordinating with crew leaders to adjust construction schedule and plan; provide on-site guidance and direction to construction crew; arrange and conduct site inspections; document any adjustments and conditions upon completion of construction activities. -Revegetation Oversight: Oversee implementation of approved revegetation plans to ensure that revegetation outcomes meet project objectives, which includes inspecting plant materials; coordinating with vendor/crews conducting site preparation, seeding, planting, and mulching activities regarding placement locations; and documenting any field adjustments and conditions upon completion of revegetation activities. -Engineering Designs: Prepare engineering designs for small-scale water diversion works, flow measurement devices, or minor stream bank stabilization projects. These designs may or may not require an engineer's stamp, depending on permit requirements and the specific feature being designed. The total amount of work requested under this task is expected to be minor relative to the previously listed tasks. -Communication and Coordination: Interact with interdisciplinary planning teams; organize, facilitate, and or/participate in meetings, project planning sessions, and workshops with design teams, stakeholders, government agencies, working groups, or the public; assist commission with outreach regarding construction activities; prepare agendas, meeting notes, and visual aids; and maintain regular communication with Commission. -Reporting: Prepare a written report or memorandum documenting activities completed as part of any/all of the previously listed tasks. Specific content requirements typically require draft and final versions of reports and will include maps, drawings, and other graphics. 3.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 2.1 Applicable Documents - The document(s) listed below form a part of this contract/purchase order including modifications or exclusions. 2.1.1 ""Document References"" listed below must be obtained by the Contractor. Ordering information is included as an attachment to this contract/purchase order. 3. REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The VALVE,LINEAR,DIRECT repaired under this contract/purchase order shall meet the operational and functional requirements as represented by the Cage Code(s) and reference number(s) listed below. All repair work shall be performed in accordance with the contractors repair/overhaul standard practices, manuals and directives including but not limited to drawings, technical orders, manufacturing operations, tooling instructions, approved repair standards and any other contractor or government approved documents developed to provide technical repair procedures. CAGE___Ref. No. ;78062 21105-001; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-130, REV N, 16 NOV 2012; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the NAVICP-MECH Contracting Officer has notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, explaining the reason therefor. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings in the form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Procurement Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE ONLY - If the Manufacturer's Part Number indicated thereon has changed, but the parts are identical in all respects, supply the item and advise NAVICP-MECH immediately of the new part number. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE 4.1 Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein. Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government. The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the specification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements. 4.2 Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order. The inspection set forth in this specification shall become a part of the Contractor's overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material. 4.3 Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies. 4.4 Inspection/Testing Repaired Items - The Contractor shall perform all inspection and testing requirements as specified in the original manufacturer's specifications and drawings. 5.

REQUIREMENTS 3.1 Cage Code/Reference Number Items - The TEST SET SUBASSEMBL furnished under this contract/purchase order shall be the design represented by Cage Code(s) reference number(s). Cage _______ ref. no. ;53711 6105271 57377 6105271; 3.2 Marking - This item shall be physically identified in accordance with ;MIL-STD-129; . 3.3 Changes in Design, Material Servicing, or Part Number - Except for a Code 1 change, which shall be processed as provided in the code statement shown below, no substitution of items shall be made until the SPCC Contracting Officer has been notified and approval has been given by issuance of a written change order. When any change in design, material, servicing or part number is made to replace or substitute any item to be furnished on this contract/purchase order, the Contractor shall furnish, for the substituting/replacement item, a drawing and an explanation of the reason for the change, or a detailed description of the change, explaining the reason therefore. If finished detail drawings are not available, shop drawings inthe form used by the manufacturer will be acceptable for Government evaluation. When notifying the Contracting Officer of the reasons for making substitutions, the type of change shall be indicated by code number in accordance with one of the following statements: Code 1: PART NUMBER CHANGE/MINOR DESIGN CHANGE - If the Manufacturer's Part Number or item design indicated thereon has changed, but form, fit and function of the item is not affected thereby, and the design change meets the criteria for minor, by not effecting form, fit, function, reliability or safety , supply the item and advise SPCC immediately of the new part number, furnishing a detail drawing and/or a detailed description of the change, as applicable. Code 2: Assembly (or set or kit) not furnished - Used following detail parts. Code 3: Part not furnished separately - Use assembly. Code 4: Part redesigned - Old and new parts are completely interchangeable. Code 5: Part redesigned - New part replaces old. Old part cannot replace new. Code 6: Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable. 3.4 Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination. Mercury contamination of the material will be cause for rejection. If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture. The contractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape. Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting Officer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a ""Warning Plate"" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part. The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited. The most probable causes of contamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity. Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are located so as not to constitute a contamination hazard. If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective. Enclose the equipment in a polyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the requirements of this contract are concerned. These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements. Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer. For background, the following information is provided: Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys. Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems. Accidental trapping of mercury in a component could cause serious damage to vital parts. Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface ship atmosphere. 4.

" Supplies: Ammunition, Guns, Weapons, Flares Bids",DC,NASA Announcement of Opportunity for Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3),Federal,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,"Sep 1, 2022",National Aeronautics and Space Administration,https://sam.gov/opp/b5a74d9fdd5e4212bd2dbf4495f19f96/view,"NNH17ZDA004O    		    		 ",Purchasing,,202-358-2088,michael.h.new@nasa.gov,,"This April 2022 SAM.gov amendment to the Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) announces that the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) has been updated to show May 1, 2023, as the new closing date for SALMON-3.? NASA also has shortened the title of the SAM.gov title that was published first by the FBO in 2017. On March 22, 2017, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released the Third Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-3) Announcement of Opportunity, and the full text of the solicitation became available on the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/. SALMON-3 is an omnibus NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO). ?? The SALMON-3 AO provides a solicitation and procurement base (the common AO body) for modest investigations, also referred to as Missions of Opportunity (MO), requiring space flight that advance the high priority science, exploration, and technology objectives of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate. The SALMON-3 AO describes the common requirements for all MO proposal opportunities, as outlined in the AO body and common Appendices A through H. Subsequent appendices called Program Element Appendices, or PEAs, document specific requirements for each proposal opportunity.? At the time of this AO's release, Appendix I, the MMX Neutron Gamma-Ray Spectrometer Investigation, was the only proposal opportunity. Subsequently, additional proposal opportunities, PEAs J through O, have been added.? A PEA-specific FBO notice highlights an opportunity to propose when NASA amends SALMON-3 to add a new or to revise an existing PEA. This FBO notice announces that NSPIRES will post an amendment to SALMON-3's common AO body on or after October 22, 2019.? Prior to the issuance of this amendment, NASA released PEAs I through O as amendments to the SALMON-3 AO; therefore, this amendment does not change PEAs I through O.? PEAs released after the date of this amendment are subject to these changes unless specified otherwise in the PEA. This FBO notice is not a complete or verbatim summary of the changes included in Amendment 17 to the common body of SALMON-3; therefore, it is necessary to visit NSPIRES and download the full version of the common AO body. NASA is modifying SALMON-3 to make several changes to better align the common AO body to version 5.0 of the Standard Principal Investigator (PI)-led Mission AO Template found at https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/standardao/sao_templates.html.? The amendment's changes range from simple updates, e.g., a new point of contact for SALMON-3's common AO body, to complex matters related to requirements, sections, and common appendices that the PEAs share.? For example, for future PEAs that use the Two-Step evaluation process, several requirements are deferred to Step Two.? For PEAs with a Single or One-Step evaluation process, deferrals are not possible. Other changes include: 1. Some NASA documents referenced in SALMON-3 have newer versions and the newer document references replace the older versions. 2. Appendix H adds a note acknowledging that in December 2020 the Duns and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System will no longer be the official identifier (ID) for doing business with the U.S. Government and references the source-for-more information URL: gsa.gov/entityid. Participation in SALMON-3 opportunities is, in general, open to all categories of organizations (U.S. and non-U.S.), including educational institutions, industry, not-for-profit organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, NASA Centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other Government agencies.? ?It is necessary to visit NSPIRES and download the full text of the common AO body for the details of the types of limitations that NASA may place on a specific, contracted evaluation, assessment, or support organization.? This FBO notice summarizes two types of limitation as: 1. Full Limitation: NASA precludes a support organization from participating in any capacity in support of a respondent under this AO. 2. Partial Limitation: Under appropriate circumstances and conditions that are specified in the SALMON-3 AO common body, or in a specific PEA, NASA permits respondents to contract with a NASA support organization for certain services. The SALMON-3 common AO body lists the names of two NASA-contracted evaluation-support organizations, Cornell Technical Services (CTS) and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) and its subsidiaries and affiliates.? Participation by these two organizations is subject to full limitation in proposed investigations as described in detail in the common AO body. SALMON-3 also lists an independent program assessment organization, Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace).? Aerospace's participation may or may not be subject to a full or a partial limitation. Sometimes individual PEAs place other restrictions or limitations on categories of organizations, such as limiting non-U.S. organizations to collaborating only with a U.S. Lead. The SALMON-3 solicitation is open from March 22, 2017, through March 18, 2022. Lapses in Government funding may impact some dates specified in the SALMON-3 AO, including some PEAs.? In the event of future lapses to the NASA operations, proposers should visit NSPIRES, the official NASA source for the full SALMON-3, including all of its PEAs.? NASA reserves the right not to make any additional awards or cancel this AO at any time.? Address questions or comments concerning the SALMON-3 common AO body via E-mail to Dr. Michael H. New, Deputy Associate Administrator for Research, Science Mission Directorate, NASA HQ, Washington, DC 20546; E-mail: Michael.H.New@nasa.gov.? In the subject line of such emails, please type ""SALMON-3 Common AO Body.""

ROSES is an omnibus solicitation with many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. Table 2 and Table 3 of this NRA, which will be posted at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2022table3, respectively, provide proposal due dates and hypertext links to descriptions of the solicited program elements in the Appendices of this NRA. Together, these program elements cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. The ROSES NRA is written to allow any individual program element to issue any type of award but, at the time of release, all elements are written so that extramural awards will be grants or cooperative agreements. In general, contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all research involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of hardware for science experiments and/or flight). Periods of performance are typically three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. The funds available and the anticipated number of awards are given in each program element and range from less than one to several million dollars, which allows for selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals. Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to ROSES-2022 must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov in addition to being registered with NSPIRES. Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) (AOR) who will submit the electronic proposal. All proposal team members must be registered in NSPIRES regardless of the submission system so we may perform automatic organizational conflict of interest checking of reviewers. Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and to enter the requested information. Notices of intent to propose and Step-1 Proposals will be due starting in April 2022 and Full (Step-2) Proposals will be due no earlier than May 16, 2022, through no later than May 12, 2023, by which time it is expected that the first full (Step-2) proposal due dates for next ROSES solicitation will occur. Potential proposers are strongly encouraged to read Section I(d) of the ROSES Summary of Solicitation that lists Significant Changes from Recent ROSES. To learn of the addition of new program elements and all amendments to this NRA, proposers may: (1) Subscribe to the SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and checking the appropriate boxes under ""Account Management"" and ""Email Subscriptions""). (2) Get automatic updates of due dates using the ROSES-2022 due date Google calendar. Instructions will be available shortly after release at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/library-and-useful-links (link from the words due date calendar). (3) Check the ROSES-2022 Blog at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2022/. Frequently asked questions about ROSES-2022 will be posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/ shortly after release. Questions concerning the individual program elements in ROSES should be directed to the point(s) of contact in the Summary Table of Key Information at the end of the program element and at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list/. Subject matter experts are encouraged to sign up to be a volunteer reviewer at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/volunteer-review-panels."

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Oregon State Office intends to award one (1) firm fixed price construction contract for Boiler Replacement at the Bureau of Land Management - Medford Interagency Office located in Medford, Oregon within the vicinity of Medford district area of responsibility as a sole source to Johnson Controls, Inc. as the only responsible source pursuant to FAR subpart 6.302-1. The contractor is uniquely qualified to provide this type of HVAC facility improvement for the Medford Interagency Office. Johnson Controls Inc.'s Metasys software is proprietary to Johnson Controls and is currently in use at the Medford Interagency Office. JCI Metasys requires specialized knowledge and experience that only JCI Metasys control technicians possess; new boilers must be connected to the existing JCI Metsys and only authorized JCI technicians may complete this work to connect the new boilers to the existing JCI Metasys system. The existing JCI Metasys software operates in conjunction with the existing JCI direct digital controls system which the government already owns and shall remain in place at the Medford Interagency Office. The cost to reprocure these systems (JCI Metasys and JCI direct digital controls) from another vendor would exceed any savings realized from competing this requirement. In addition, the Metasys is the only building automation/energy management system allowed by the BLM Information Technology Security Program to be connected to the BLM network. No solicitation package will be available for this requirement. No telephone or fax requests will be accepted. The performance period is from July 2022 through November 2022.

Both the timber bulkhead and platform are deteriorating and the structural integrity of both are now in jeopardy. The bulkhead is shifting, causing upland adjacent work areas to sink and depress. A forklift ramp on the platform/dock area is caving in, causing a safety issue and becoming unusable - a sign of major structural deterioration.

Project includes demolition and removal of entire existing bulkhead wall and platform/dock area. Replacement infrastructure will include the installation of a stronger concrete bulkhead wall along the upland shoreline. The concrete platform/dock area will be redesigned. The area will be enclosed with a new steel sheet pile bulkhead and then backfilled - removing the need for structural pilings. A new concrete platform will be installed on the newly enclosed and backfilled platform area. This will ensure structural integrity into the future."
